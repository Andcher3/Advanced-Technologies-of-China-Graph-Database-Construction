{Abstract}: Supramolecular multifunctional metal–organic networks offer immense potential in drug delivery, bioimaging, catalysis, and therapeutics. However, the creation of multiple stimuli‐responsive fluorescent hollow nano/microparticles is a formidable challenge in this field. In this study, a novel strategy is reported for synthesizing photochromic hollow microparticles that exhibit responsiveness to light, pH, and glutathione (GSH). With the assistance of templating coordination from zeolitic imidazolate framework‐8 microparticles, bisphosphonate‐merocyanine ligands are successfully assembled to create hollow bisphosphonate‐spiropyran (BPSP)‐Zn2+ microparticles. The photochromic and pH responses stem from the reversible conversion between spiropyran and zwitterionic merocyanine components and between merocyanine and protonated merocyanine, respectively. The GSH response is attributed to the stronger affinity of Zn2+ to thiol groups than to phosphonate groups. These remarkable features render t...

{Abstract}: Chemical Artificial Intelligence (CAI) is a brand-new research line that exploits molecular, supramolecular, and systems chemistry in wetware (i.e., in fluid solutions) to imitate some performances of human intelligence and promote unconventional robotics based on molecular assemblies, which act in the microscopic world, otherwise tough to be accessed by humans. It is undoubtedly worth spreading the news that AI researchers can rely on the help of chemists and biotechnologists to reach the ambitious goals of building intelligent systems from scratch. This article reports the first attempt at building a Chemical Artificial Intelligence knowledge map and describes the basic intelligent functions that can be implemented through molecular and supramolecular chemistry. Chemical Artificial Intelligence provides new tools and concepts to mimic human intelligence because it shares, with biological intelligence, the same principles and materials. It enables peculiar dynamics, possibly not accessible in software and ha...

{Abstract}: A supramolecular assembly was obtained by combining methylene blue (MB) with a natural plant extract, curcumin (Curc), in a stoichiometric ratio of 1:4 in aqueous solution (90% PBS + 10% ethanol) at room temperature. The MB-Curc supramolecular assembly was evidenced by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, and the stoichiometry and bonding constant were obtained using Cieleńs model. Its stability and photostability were evaluated by chromatographic analysis and UV–Vis absorption. The MB-Curc avoids the aggregation of both isolated compounds and efficiently produces singlet oxygen (ΦΔ= 0.52 ± 0.03). Its potential for photodynamic antiangiogenic treatments was evaluated through the vascular effect observed in chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The results showed intense damage in CAM vascular network by MB-Curc after irradiation, which is higher than the effect of isolated compounds, indicating a synergistic vascular effect. This combination can be essential to prevent cancer revascularization ...

{Abstract}: CrO42− is a Group 1 human carcinogen that can induce pathological alterations in various human systems upon excessive exposure in aqueous media. In this study, a supramolecular assembly was synthesized by exploiting the host-guest interaction between symmetric tetramethyl cucurbit[6]uril (TMeQ[6]) and (E)-4-(4-hydroxystyryl) pyridin-1-ammonium chloride (G) as the building blocks. The supramolecular assembly of TMeQ[6]@G in water was characterized by various methods (1H NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy, single crystal diffraction techniques, etc.), which revealed a significant enhancement of the fluorescence intensity of G upon complexation with TMeQ[6]; Moreover, TMeQ[6]@G was employed as a probe for the sensitive and selective detection of CrO42−, which quenched the fluorescence of the system remarkably. A portable platform for simple, real-time, and visual quantification of CrO42− was developed by using smartphone assisted technology, with a detection limit (DL) of ...

{Abstract}: Coumarins, in general, exhibit a wide range of photophysical characteristics and are highly sensitive to their microenvironment, and, therefore, their fluorescence characteristics have attracted immense attention as sensors in chemical and biological systems. In the present study, the supramolecular interaction of a bichromophoric coumarin dye, namely, Coumarin 7 (C7) with sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE7βCD) macrocyclic host at different pH conditions has been investigated by using optical spectroscopic techniques such as absorption, steady-state and time-resolved emissions, and circular dichroism measurements and compared with that of βCD. Considerable enhancement in the fluorescence intensity and lifetime of C7 on complexation with SBE7βCD proposes that non-radiative processes like TICT behavior are strictly hindered due to the confinement in the host cavity experienced by the C7 dye. The increase in the rotational correlation time evaluated from the fluorescence anisotropy decay ...

{Abstract}: Water, as a ubiquitous and essential component of life, is known to have a significant impact on the structure and function of organic molecules. In this study, we investigate the role of water in the phase transition of organic molecular assembly structures by scanning tunneling microscopy at room temperature. The results show that the -O-H···O hydrogen induced by water molecules can lead to a significant structural transition in the molecular assembly, specifically through selective weakening of -C-H···O between 6-aminonicotinic acid and the formation of new -O-H···O bonds between 6-aminonicotinic acid and water molecules. Subsequent thermal treatment of these molecular assembly structures reveals that the formation of -N-H···O hydrogen bonds induced by water molecules has created a different pathway for the phase transition of the molecular assembly structure. This knowledge has important implications for the design of organic molecules with specific nanostructures that can be controlled through hydration.

{Abstract}: In this study, we present a colloidal assembly of histidyl bolaamphiphiles whose imidazoles coordinate with rhodium ions (HisC7[Rh]) to exhibit catalytic isomerization activity for cis-stilbene and cis-alkene molecules. The histidyl bolaamphiphiles self-assemble to form a soft scaffold that functions analogously to an apoenzyme. This scaffold exposes multiple histidyl imidazoles and carboxylates on its surface, to which rhodium ions bind, generating catalytically active sites. The Rh coordination with the biochemical functional groups was verified through comprehensive vibrational spectroscopy and calorimetry. The colloidal HisC7[Rh] demonstrated a significant catalytic effect on the isomerization of cis- to trans-stilbene under mild H2 conditions, resulting in 69% yield of trans-stilbene. In contrast, when Rh(cod)2BF4 was employed as a control catalyst, only the hydrogenated products of bibenzyl were obtained. These findings underscore the crucial role of histidyl motifs in e...

{Abstract}: The advancements in understanding the phenomenon of plasma interactions with matter, coupled with the development of CAPP devices, have resulted in an interdisciplinary research topic of significant importance. This has led to the integration of various fields of science, including plasma physics, chemistry, biomedical sciences, and engineering. The reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species generated from cold atmospheric plasma on interaction with biomolecules like proteins and peptides form various supramolecular structures. CAPP treatment of amino acids, which are the fundamental building blocks of proteins, holds potential in creating self-assembled supramolecular architectures. In this work, we demonstrate the process of self-assembly of aromatic amino acid tryptophan (Trp) enantiomers (l-tryptophan and d-tryptophan) into ordered supramolecular assemblies induced by the reactive species generated by a cold atmospheric pressure helium plasma jet. These enantiomers of tryptophan form organized ...

{Abstract}: In this work, we considered the formation of supramolecular assemblies of melamine-thiobarbiturate and melamine-barbiturate-thiobarbiturate. It is known that thiobarbituric acid can form many tautomers, as well as different motifs due to the change of C2=O to C2=S hydrogen bonds. We formed the crystal. The resulting crystals were studied with scanning electron microscopy （SEM）, optical fluorescence microscopy, single crystal and powder （PXRD） X-ray diffraction analyses, and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance （ss NMR）. These systems were theoretically studied using density functional theory （DFT） and classical molecular dynamics （MD） simulations. Interestingly, just as in the case of melamine barbiturate, during the crystallization process, hydrogen from the C5 moiety of thiobarbituric acid migrates to the melamine molecule. In addition, the resulting melamine thiobarbiturate crystals exhibit fluorescence behavior in the red region （565–605 nm）, while the melamine barbiturate crystals are fluore...

{Abstract}: The development of organic materials that deliver room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is highly interesting for potential applications such as anticounterfeiting, optoelectronic devices, and bioimaging. Herein, a molecular chaperone strategy for controlling isolated chromophores to achieve high-performance RTP is demonstrated. Systematic experiments coupled with theoretical evidence reveal that the host plays a similar role as a molecular chaperone that anchors the chromophores for limited nonradiative decay and directs the proper conformation of guests for enhanced intersystem crossing through noncovalent interactions. For deduction of structure-property relationships, various structure-related descriptors that correlate with the RTP performance are identified, thus offering the possibility to quantitatively design and predict the phosphorescent behaviors of these systems. Furthermore, application in thermal printing is well realized for these RTP materials. The present work discloses an effective strateg...

{Abstract}: Macrocyclic compounds show highly symmetric structures, making them useful building blocks for the creation of various supramolecular assemblies. The properties of such supramolecular assemblies result from their shape, functionality, and structure. In 2008, we reported a new type of polygonal-shaped macrocycle termed “pillar[n]arenes”. In this Focus Review, based on their polygonal structures, versatile functionality, and host–guest behavior, I present various pillar[n]arene-based supramolecular assemblies that have been investigated over the last 10 years in our group. Based on the versatile functionalization of pillar[n]arenes, continuous and length-controllable discrete one-dimensional channels, two-dimensional sheets, and three-dimensional vesicles have been produced. Bulk-state complexations using liquid and crystalline pillar[n]arenes are also discussed. The functionalization of pillar[n]arenes is also useful for creating functionalized crystals, and such crystals have shown guest-responsive changes in...

{Abstract}: The facile synthesis of chiral materials is of paramount importance for various applications. Supramolecular preorganization of monomers for thermal polymerization has been proven as an effective tool to synthesize carbon and carbon nitride‐based (CN) materials with ordered morphology and controlled properties. However, the transfer of an intrinsic chemical property, such as chirality from supramolecular assemblies to the final material after thermal condensation, was not shown. Here, we report the large‐scale synthesis of chiral CN materials capable of enantioselective recognition. To achieve this, we designed supramolecular assemblies with a chiral center that remains intact at elevated temperatures. The optimized chiral CN demonstrates an enantiomeric preference of ca. 14 %; CN electrodes were also prepared and show stereoselective interactions with enantiomeric probes in electrochemical measurements. By adding chirality to the properties transferrable from monomers to the final product of a thermal polyme...

{Abstract}: The microphase separation of double-hydrophilic block copolymers in water is of interest when these copolymers are utilized as molecular assemblies with mesoscale aqueous compartments. Diblock copolymers composed of a water-soluble zwitterionic polymer, poly(carboxybetaine acrylate) (PCBA2), and a hydrophilic water-insoluble nonionic polymer, poly(2-methoxyethyl acrylate) (PMEA), (PCBA2n-b-PMEAm) were synthesized, and their assembly characteristics were investigated in aqueous solutions. Well-defined PCBA2n-b-PMEAm block copolymers were synthesized by the reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization of a carboxybetaine acrylate modified with a tert-butyl group and 2-methoxyethyl acrylate followed by tert-butyl group cleavage. PCBA2n-b-PMEAm produced particles in dilute aqueous solutions and microphase-separated structures in concentrated aqueous solutions. The hydrodynamic radius of the particles and the microphase-separated ...

{Abstract}: With the rise of quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods, the interest in the calculation of molecular assemblies has increased considerably. The structures and dynamics of such assemblies are usually governed to a large extend by intermolecular interactions. As a result, the corresponding potential energy surfaces are topological rich and possess many shallow minima. Therefore, local structure optimizations of QM/MM molecular assemblies can be challenging, in particular if optimization constraints are imposed. To overcome this problem, structure optimization in normal coordinate space is advocated. To do so, the external degrees of freedom of a molecule are separated from the internal ones by a projector matrix in the space of the Cartesian coordinates. Here we extend this approach to Cartesian constraints. To this end, we devise an algorithm that adds the Cartesian constraints directly to the projector matrix and in this way eliminates them from the reduced coordinate space in which the mole...

{Abstract}: Fine‐tuning the thermodynamic self‐assembly of molecules via volatile solid additives has emerged to be an effective way to construct high‐performance organic solar cells. Here, three‐dimensional structured solid molecules have been designed and applied to facilitate the formation of organized molecular assembly in the active layer. By means of systematic theory analyses and film‐morphology characterizations based on four solid candidates, we preselected the optimal one, 4‐fluoro‐N,N‐diphenylaniline (FPA), which possesses good volatility and strong charge polarization. The three‐dimensional solids can induce molecular packing in active layers via strong intermolecular interactions and subsequently provide sufficient space for the self‐reassembly of active layers during the thermodynamic transition process. Benefitting from the optimized morphology with improved charge transport and reduced energy disorder in the FPA‐processed devices, high efficiencies of over 19 % were achieved. The strategy of three‐dimensi...

{Abstract}: Efficient separation and purification of xenon (Xe) from krypton (Kr) represent an industrially crucial but challenging process. While the adsorption-based separation of these atomic gases represents an energy-efficient process, achieving highly selective adsorbents remains a difficult task. Here, we demonstrate a supramolecular assembly of coordination polymers, termed as M(II)-dhbq (M = Mg, Mn, Co, and Zn; dhbq = 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone), with high-density open metal sites (5.3 nm-3) and optimal pore size (5.5 Å), which are able to selectively capture Xe among other chemically inert gases including Kr, Ar, N2, and O2. Among M(II)-dhbq materials, Mn-dhbq exhibits the highest Xe uptake capacity of 3.1 mmol/g and a Xe/Kr selectivity of 11.2 at 298 K and 1.0 bar, outperforming many state-of-the-art adsorbents reported so far. Remarkably, the adsorption selectivity of Mn-dhbq for Xe/O2, Xe/N2, and Xe/Ar at ambient conditions reaches as high as 70.0, 1...

{Abstract}: Comprehensive Summary(#br)Making full use of coordination‐driven self‐assembly strategy, we herein described the selective synthesis of a molecular Borromean rings and two cases of “U”‐shaped tweezer‐like molecular assemblies in high yield by using bipyridyl ligands based on biphenyl unit and half‐sandwich binuclear rhodium(III)/iridium(III) building blocks. The selective synthesis was realized by adjusting the length of dipyridyl arms. The utilization of curved U‐shaped bipyridyl ligand L1 led to tweezer‐like molecular assemblies. Subsequently, olefinic bonds were introduced to elongate dipyridyl arms obtaining ligand L2. The ligand L2 has two stable conformations, U‐shape and Z‐shape, which facilitated the formation of different topologies including the tetranuclear macrocycle and Borromean rings with different building blocks in this work. These structures in solid and solution all have been further confirmed by single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction, NMR analysis, and mass spectrometry. In addition, as an impor...

{Abstract}: Cancer nanovaccine is a promising therapeutic strategy; however, the complicated composition and ambiguous structure of cancer nanovaccines hinder their clinical application. Thus, developing minimalist nanovaccine with simple structural molecule and potent immunostimulatory function is with great value. Herein, an organic small molecule with well‐defined molecular structure and strong aggregation‐induced emission (AIE) activity is synthesized. This molecule can self‐assemble into nanoparticle (NM‐7) acting as not only adjuvant but also carrier to capture model antigen ovalbumin to form nanovaccine, which can effectively deliver and chronically release antigens and induce effective antigen cross‐presentation in draining lymph nodes. Additionally, the photophysical property of AIE molecule facilitates the determination of in vivo tissue distribution of NM‐7. Notably, NM‐7/ovalbumin (OVA) nanovaccine induces robust tumor‐specific CD8+ T‐cell responses with greatly reduced cell exhaustion. Accordingly...

{Abstract}: In recent years, circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials have attracted much interest because of their promising applications in many research fields, such as photoelectric devices and information storage systems. This importance has stimulated the rapid development of stimuli-responsive CPL-active materials. Responsive chiral multicomponent assembled materials are prepared by incorporating chiral group and responsive luminescent components, which play an important role in developing the intelligent CPL materials. Depending on the non-covalent interactions during the process of multicomponent co-assembly, the supramolecular assembly systems provide various methods to regulate CPL features using external stimuli such as temperature, light, solvent, pH, metal ions, electric fields, and mechanical force. This review summarizes the recent progress in stimuli-responsive multicomponent co-assembled systems major when gel and chiral nematic liquid crystal are present. Future challenges and opportunities are...

{Abstract}: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of large biomolecular machines and highly repetitive proteins remain challenging due to the difficulty of assigning frequencies to individual nuclei. Here, we present an efficient strategy to address this challenge by engineering a Pyrococcus horikoshii tRNA/alanyl-tRNA synthetase pair that enables the incorporation of up to three isotopically labeled alanine residues in a site-specific manner using in vitro protein expression. The general applicability of this approach for NMR assignment has been demonstrated by introducing isotopically labeled alanines into four distinct proteins: huntingtin exon-1, HMA8 ATPase, the 300 kDa molecular chaperone ClpP, and the alanine-rich Phox2B transcription factor. For large protein assemblies, our labeling approach enabled unambiguous assignments while avoiding potential artifacts induced by site-specific mutations. When applied to Phox2B, which contains two poly-alanine tracts of nine and twenty alanines, we observed that the helic...

{Abstract}: The facile synthesis of chiral materials is of paramount importance for various applications. Supramolecular preorganization of monomers for thermal polymerization has been proven as an effective tool to synthesize carbon and carbon nitride-based (CN) materials with ordered morphology and controlled properties. However, the transfer of an intrinsic chemical property, such as chirality from supramolecular assemblies to the final material after thermal condensation, has never been shown. Here, we report the large-scale synthesis of chiral CN materials capable of enantioselective recognition. To achieve this, we designed supramolecular assemblies with a chiral center that remains intact at elevated temperatures. The optimized chiral CN demonstrates an enantiomeric preference of ca. 14%; CN electrodes were also prepared and show stereoselective interactions with enantiomeric probes in electrochemical measurements. By adding chirality to the properties transferrable from monomers to the final product of a thermal ...

{Abstract}: The multi-scale supramolecular assembly (MSSA)-based extraction strategy with hydroxyl-functionalized ionic liquid (IL) is promising in the separation of metal ions from radioactive environments for which a comprehensive understanding toward the radiation stability of the MSSA system is necessary. Herein, we report on the analyses of the radiation stability of MSSA in extraction, especially the adopted ILs 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (IL-1) and 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (IL-2), by UV-vis, 1H NMR, and ESI-HRMS. It was found that the macroscopic assembly (MA) sphere could not be formed after γ irradiation on the extraction system with IL-1. On the contrary, the trisubstituted IL-2 instead of the disubstituted IL-1 remarkably improved the radiation stability of the MSSA system to guarantee the formation of the MA sphere. The high extraction efficiency could be kept, and the mechanism of such an improvemen...

{Abstract}: Flame retardant treatment of epoxy resins to reduce their flammability for extending their range of applications attracts considerable attention. However, the synthesis process of conventional flame retardants is complicated and involves organic hazardous solvents. Meanwhile, how to ensure both the flame-retardant and mechanical properties is a long-standing and actual difficult problem. In this work, a supramolecular flame retardant (ATPFR) is facilely created by one-pot reaction, using cheap and accessible raw materials in an ecologically benign aqueous solvent. ATPFR is applied to improve the fire safety of epoxy (EP) thermosets. With only 5wt% ATPFR addition, the limiting oxygen index of EP thermoset can reach 28.5%, and can reach UL-94 V-0 rating with a significant "blow-out effect". The cone calorimetry test reveals that the EP thermoset with 5wt% ATPFR has a 75.8% reduction in the peak heat release rate (p-HRR) and a 67.3% reduction in the peak smoke production rate (p-SPR), respectively, compared with...

{Abstract}: The development of highly efficient and minimally toxic agents with targeting abilities toward tumor tissues is an ongoing area of research in the fight against cancer. Different from the mononuclear and multinuclear metallodrug complexes, impressively, the unique supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) have shown great superiority in cancer treatment. The vast combinational flexibility of ligands and metal ions offers limitless opportunities to form desired SCCs, thus endows them with distinct, captivating and integrated biological and chemical properties. Compared to organic drugs that are predominantly one-dimensional (1D) or two-dimensional (2D) in shape, the structurally much more complicated three-dimensional (3D) multinuclear assemblies with elaborate sizes, shapes, or cavities can exhibit unexpected binding sensitivity and selectivity toward biomolecules. Over the last decades, significant progress has been made in the design and synthesis of novel SCCs for intensive cancer therapy. These assembl...

{Abstract}: Coordination-driven self-assembly enables the spontaneous construction of metallo-supramolecules with high precision, facilitated by dynamic and reversible metal-ligand interactions. The dynamic nature of coordination, however, results in structural lability in many metallo-supramolecular assembly systems. Consequently, it remains a formidable challenge to achieve self-assembly reversibility and structural stability simultaneously in metallo-supramolecular systems. To tackle this issue, herein, we incorporate an acid-/base-responsive tridentate ligand into multitopic building blocks to precisely construct a series of metallo-supramolecular cages through coordination-driven self-assembly. These dynamic cagelike assemblies can be transformed to their static states through mild in situ deprotonation/oxidation, leading to ultrastable skeletons that can withstand high temperatures, metal ion chelators, and strong acid/base conditions. This in situ transformation provides a reliable and powerful approach to manipul...

{Abstract}: Stereocomplexation, or specific interactions among complementary stereoregular macromolecules, is burgeoning as an increasingly impactful design tool, exerting exquisite control of material structure and properties. Since stereocomplexation of polymers produces remarkable transformations in mechanics, morphology, and degradation, we sought to leverage stereocomplexation to tune these properties in peptide-based biomaterials. We found that blending the pentapeptides l- and d-KYFIL triggers dual mechanical and morphological transformations from stiff fibrous hydrogels into less stiff networks of plates, starkly contrasting prior reports that blending l- and d-peptides produces stiffer fibrous hydrogels than the individual constituents. The morphological transformation of KYFIL in phosphate-buffered saline from fibers that entangle into hydrogels to plates that cannot entangle explains the accompanying mechanical transformation. Moreover, the blends shield l-KYFIL from proteolytic degradation, producing material...

Electronic wavefunction coupling in the supercrystal helps the authors to introduce minibands and guide the relaxation of photogenerated charge carriers.

{Abstract}: Gold (III) complex-based amphiphiles in aqueous media have recently been demonstrated with high structural sensitivity to external stimulations, enabling new prospect for soft functional material applications. Here we demonstrate an advanced supramolecular assembly system of gold (III) amphiphiles reversibly controlled by counterions exchange. More importantly, the luminescent properties of the gold (III) amphiphiles are enhanced by implementation of σ-donating mono-alkynyl ligand. Gold (III) amphiphiles demonstrate with good cytocompatibilities to human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.

{Abstract}: A new N–P–Cu containing supermolecular assembly network (MPCSN) was fabricated with titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) nanosheets through intermolecular forces, and then, the flame-retardant thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanocomposites were synthesized by melt blending. The obtained results of the TPU/Ti3C2Tx-MPCSN system indicated that the temperature corresponding to T5% of TPU nanocomposites by adding 2% Ti3C2Tx or 2% MPCSN decreased to 269.1 and 311.5 °C, respectively. Simultaneously, a well dispersion of the loading of 1.0 mass% Ti3C2Tx-MPCSN was found in TPU matrix. Accordingly, the thermal stability of TPU can be found to be substantially improved in the thermogravimetric analysis, which was embodied in the mass loss of TPU/Ti3C2Tx-MPCSN-1.0 reached up to 8.47 mass%. Moreover, the cone calorimeter tests revealed that the peak of heat ...

{Abstract}: White light emitting materials have broad application prospects in fields such as displays, lighting devices, etc., but developing such materials faces considerable challenges. In this study, 1,3,5-tris[4-(pyridine-4-butyl)phenyl]benzene derivative (BTPY) was synthesized and a supramolecular assembly with AIE properties named BTPY@Q[7] was prepared with cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]). Furthermore, by adding rhodamine 6G (R6G) to it, and controlling its ratio with R6G, a dual-emission white light system (0.33, 0.33) was synthesized and used for white light emitting materials as well as anti-counterfeiting fields. In addition, based on the BTPY@Q[7]-R6G system, a light harvesting system in aqueous phase was constructed, with an energy transfer efficiency (ΦET) of 26.19 % and an antenna effect (AE) of 10.21. Interestingly, the supramolecular self-assembly can also be used as a fluorescent probe, specifically recognize Fe(CN)63− ions in water, with a detection limit of 2.5 × 10−8 M.

{Abstract}: Herein, we present the gas-dependent electrical properties of a reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized by reducing GO with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). As-synthesized rGO was dispersed in DI water containing 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 wt% polyethylene glycol (PEG) to prepare PEG-rGO supramolecular assemblies. The successful preparation of supramolecular assemblies was verified by their characterization using XRD, FESEM, EDS, TEM, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy. At room temperature, the gas-dependent electrical properties of these supramolecular assemblies were investigated. The results showed that sensors composed of PEG-rGO supramolecular assemblies performed better against benzene and methanol at 3% and 4% PEG, respectively. However, high selectivity and a wide range of activation energies (∼1.64-1.91 eV) were observed for H2 for 4% PEG-modified supramolecular assemblies. The PEG-rGO supramolecular assemblies may be an excellent candidate for constru...

{Abstract}: Noncovalent interactions are vitally important to understand the structural stability and molecular assembly of cellulose and its analog molecules. Using density functional theory in conjunction with three popular generations of dispersion correction （D2, D3, D4）, we systematically estimate the strength of inter-chain interaction for several β-1,4-linked crystalline polysaccharides （cellulose Iα, Iβ, II, IIII, α-chitin, β-chitin, chitosan） and their building block monomers （glucose, cellobiose）. Switching on and off dispersion correction and combining the calculation of condensed and isolated chains allow the extraction of the intra- and inter-chain London dispersion interactions and the inter-chain electrostatic interaction. Regardless of the generations of dispersion correction and allomorphs, the estimated inter-chain London dispersion interaction is 45 ~ 74 kJ/mol per pyranose ring comparable to the inter-chain electrostatic interaction （47 ~ 88 kJ/mol）. The upper limit of the strength of inter...

{Abstract}: Molecular complexes of 4-cyanophenylboronic acid (CB) with various N-donor compounds having different conformational features, for example, rigid (1,10-phenanthroline (110phen), 4,7-phenanthroline (47phen), 1,7-phenanthroline (17phen) and acridine (acr)) and linear (1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (bpyea), 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene (bpyee) and 4,4'-azopyridine (azopy)), have been reported. In all complexes, the -B(OH)2 moiety is found to be in a syn-anti confirmation, with the exception of structures containing 110phen, bpyee, and azopy, wherein, syn-syn conformation is observed. Further, CB molecules remain intact in all structures except in the complexes with some linear N-donor ligands, wherein -B(OH)2 transforms to monoester (-B(OH)(OCH3)) prior to the formation of corresponding molecular complexes. In such boronic monoester complexes, the conformation of -B(OH)(OCH3) is syn-anti with respect to the -OH and -OCH3 groups. Also, complexes mediated by azopy and ...

{Abstract}: Developing biocompatible nitric oxide (NO) photoreleasing nanoconstucts is of great interest in view of the large variety of biological roles that NO plays and the unique advantage light offers in controlling NO release in space and time. In this contribution, we report the supramolecular assemblies of two NO photodonors (NOPDs), NBF-NO and RHD-NO, as water-dispersible nanogels, ca. 10 nm in diameter, based on γ-cyclodextrins (γ-CDng). These NOPDs, containing amino-nitro-benzofurazan and rhodamine chromophores as light harvesting antennae, can be activated by visible light, are highly hydrophobic and can be effectively entrapped within the γ-CDng. Despite being confined in a very restricted environment, neither NOPD suffer self-aggregation and preserve their photochemical and photophysical properties well. The blue light excitation of the weakly fluorescent γ-CDng/NBF-NO complex results in effective NO release and the concomitant generation of the highly green, fluorescent co-product, which acts as an optical...

{Abstract}: Gold (III) cyclometalated based amphiphiles in aqueous media have been revealed with excellent supramolecular transformations to external stimuli to open new pathways for soft functional material fabrications. Herein, we report a new chiral cyclometalated gold (III) amphiphile (GA) assembling into lamellar nanostructures in aqueous media confirmed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Counterion exchange with D-, L-, or racemic-camphorsulfonates features the significant supramolecular helicity enhancements, enabling transformations of GA from lamellar structure to vesicles and to nanotubes with multi-equivalents of counterion. The limited cytotoxicity of GA in aqueous media exhibits good biocompatibility.

{Abstract}: In this work, a high quantum level of density functional theory (DFT-D) approach and fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) at a micro-level were used to understand one phenomenon: the specific molecular mechanisms responsible for the deagglomeration effect of 10 kinds of representative molecules of bio- and petroleum-based rejuvenators on asphaltene aggregations found in the aged asphalt. The DFT results indicated that the action site of rejuvenators in sulfoxide group (S = O) position was bound stronger than those in carbonyl (C = O) and pyridine nitrogen. Compared with petroleum-based rejuvenators, bio-rejuvenators were responsible for significant contribution to the deagglomeration process when they were adequately inserted into the oxidized asphaltene dimer. Especially, 2-methoxyphenol (phenolic compounds) showed significantly higher efficiency than either of them. The deagglomeration behavior was mainly attributed to a new interaction (hydrogen-bonds of O-H··O/N-H··O and dispersion-attraction) of a ...

{Abstract}: Flexible dibenzimidazole based amphiphilic probe with indole as terminal residue has been synthesized using simple one‐step oxidative condensation. The compound formed nanoaggregates in the aqueous medium probably via extended intermolecular hydrogen bonding network involving benzimidazole moieties. The compound in monomer form (in THF) showed metal ion‐induced bathochromic shift, while in aggregate state (in water) metal coordination leads to hypsochromic shift. Moreover, in THF medium, compound interacts with large number of metal ions, whereas optical response was specifically observed with Hg2+ and Ag+ in the aqueous medium. Discrimination between Hg2+ and Ag+ was achieved using chloride as masking agent. Mechanistic investigations indicate formation of coordination‐driven supramolecular assembly where both benzimidazole and indole moieties participate in metal ion binding. The changes in microenvironment, such as local hydrophobicity, pH etc. showed distinct im...

{Abstract}: Peptidic supramolecules formed via self- and co-assembly are intensively studied and exploited from materials chemistry to biomedicine. Recently we have demonstrated that cationic, amphiphilic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are able to form co-assemblies with various anionic, aromatic small molecule (SM) binding agents, which results in modulating their activity. Herein we investigated interactions of four selected AMPs (CM15, Dhvar4, LL-37, and FK-16) with four selected SMs (suramin, tartrazine, biliverdin, and bilirubin ditaurate) exploiting the sensitivity of microscale thermophoresis (MST). Interestingly, negative thermophoresis was frequently observed, and maximal MST responses were typically found at moderate SM concentrations. Besides substantial similarities, various scenarios of thermophoretic behaviors were revealed, contributing to understanding the factors driving their interaction, including variations in charge and hydration effects, oligomeric state of the individual components, and the dynamic ...

{Abstract}: The effective removal and selective detection of explosive and toxic pollutant trinitrophenol (TNP) is an attractive but challenging field. Herein, a double-cavity nor-seco-cucurbit[10]uril (ns-Q[10])-based supramolecular assembly 8-HQ@ns-Q[10] was fabricated and its structure was characterized by X-ray single crystal diffraction. In this assembly, the stoichiometric ratio of ns-Q[10] and 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ) is 1:2, which is also attributed to the special double-cavity structure of ns-Q[10]. The luminescence sensing experiments showed that 8-HQ@ns-Q[10] can be used as a good fluorescence-enhanced sensing material (enhanced 27-fold) for the rapid detection of explosives and the aqueous contaminant TNP, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.07 × 10−5 mol/L, without interference from other phenolic compounds. Furthermore, TNP can be efficiently removed in the presence of assembly 8-HQ@ns-Q[10], and the removal efficiency is more than 89%. Therefore, the supramolecular assembly 8-HQ@ns-Q[10], as a...

{Abstract}: The understanding of interactions between organic chromophores and biocompatible luminescent noble metal nanoclusters (NCs) leading to an energy transfer process that has applications in light-harvesting materials is still in its nascent stage. This work describes a photoluminescent supramolecular assembly, made in two stages, employing an energy transfer process between silver (Ag) NCs as the donor and a host-guest system as the acceptor that can find potential applications in diverse fields. Initially, we explored the host-guest chemistry between a cationic guest ethidium bromide and cucurbit[8]uril host to modulate the fluorescence property of the acceptor. The host-guest interactions were characterized by using UV-vis absorption, steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy, molecular docking, proton 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and isothermal calorimetry studies. Next, we prepared a series of blue-emitting AgNCs using different templates such as proteins ...

{Abstract}: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of paramagnetic systems is an advancing field that contributes to characterization of the structure and magnetism of molecules, molecular assemblies, biomolecules, and materials. In this account, we utilize the hyperfine field intrinsic to ruthenium(III) coordination compounds to uncover details of their supramolecular host-guest binding with cyclodextrins. We interpret perturbations of the 1H NMR shifts of the host to suggest the binding mode of the interaction. We demonstrate how the size of the cyclodextrin cavity and the structural modification of the guest affect whether the binding occurs through a head or tail portal of the cyclodextrin and attempt to explain the observed differences in terms of molecular shapes and the charge-distribution complementarity between the host and guest. Paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy of host-guest systems is shown to be a useful tool for supramolecular and structural chemists investigating modes of molecular encapsula...

{Abstract}: 甲醛作为室内空气中的主要挥发性有机化合物之一，对人体的健康产生了极大的威胁，因此对甲醛进行检测具有重要意义.传统的电阻式气体传感器一般基于低成本和高灵敏的金属氧化物，但其较高的操作温度和较低的选择性限制了它们的实际应用.开发高性能室温甲醛传感器迫在眉睫，其核心则是寻找性能优异的室温甲醛传感材料.二维材料由于具有独特的物理化学性质和电学性能，成为高性能室温甲醛传感器的热门候选材料.另一方面，超分子组装作为一种温和的材料修饰改性策略，也为大幅提高二维材料的室温甲醛传感性能提供了可能.本文整理了近年来基于二维材料的室温甲醛传感相关工作，总结了甲醛气体分子的传感机制，梳理了二维材料的分类与特性，归纳了用于室温甲醛传感的基于二维材料“主体”的超分子组装策略，并着重介绍了二维材料基超分子组装材料在电阻式室温甲醛传感中的应用，并对二维材料基室温甲醛传感材料的未来发展进行了展望.

{Abstract}: The effective preparation of two new pyrimidine- and pyridine-based organic crystalline salts with substituted acidic moieties (i.e., (Z)-4-(naphthalen-2-ylamino)-4-oxobut-2-enoic acid (DCNO) and 2-hydroxy-3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (PCNP)) using methanol as a solvent has been reported. These molecular salts have ionic interactions that are responsible for their structural stabilization in their solid-state assemblies. The crystal structures of DCNO and PCNP were determined by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) technique. The SCXRD study inferred that cations and anions are strongly packed due to N-H···O, N-H···N, and C-H···O noncovalent interactions in DCNO, whereas in PCNP, N-H···N noncovalent interactions are absent.

{Abstract}: Natural biological materials are formed by self-assembly processes and catalyze a myriad of reactions. Here, we report a programmable molecular assembly of designed synthetic polymers with engineered bacterial spores. This self-assembly process is driven by dynamic covalent bond formation on spore surface glycan and yields macroscopic materials that are structurally stable, self-healing, and recyclable. Molecular programming of polymer species shapes the physical properties of these materials while metabolically dormant spores allow for prolonged ambient storage. Incorporation of spores with genetically encoded functionalities enables operationally simple and repeated enzymatic catalysis. Our work combines molecular and genetic engineering to offer scalable and programmable synthesis of robust materials for sustainable biocatalysis.

{Abstract}: Stimuli-responsive materials are increasingly needed for the development of smart electronic, mechanical, and biological devices and systems relying on switchable, tunable, and adaptable properties. Herein, we report a novel pH- and temperature-responsive binary supramolecular assembly involving a long-chain hydroxyamino amide (HAA) and an inorganic hydrotrope, boric acid, with highly tunable viscous and viscoelastic properties. The system under investigation demonstrates a high degree of control over its viscosity, with the capacity to achieve over four orders of magnitude of control through the concomitant manipulation of pH and temperature. In addition, the transformation from non-Maxwellian to Maxwellian fluid behavior could also be induced by changing the pH and temperature. Switchable rheological properties were ascribed to the morphological transformation between spherical vesicles, aggregated/fused spherical vesicles, and bicontinuous gyroid structures revealed by cryo-TEM studies. The observed transi...

{Abstract}: Macrocyclic confinement-induced supramolecular luminescence materials have important application value in the fields of bio-sensing, cell imaging, and information anti-counterfeiting. Herein, a tunable multicolor lanthanide supramolecular assembly with white light emission is reported, which is constructed by co-assembly of cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) encapsulating naphthylimidazolium dicarboxylic acid (G1 )/Ln (Eu3+ /Tb3+ ) complex and carbon quantum dots (CD). Benefiting from the macrocyclic confinement effect of CB[7], the supramolecular assembly not only extends the fluorescence intensity of the lanthanide complex G1 /Tb3+ by 36 times, but also increases the quantum yield by 28 times and the fluorescence lifetime by 12 times. Furthermore, the CB[7]/G1 /Ln assembly can further co-assemble with CD and diarylethene derivatives (DAE) to realize the intelligently-regulated full-color spectrum including white light, which results from the competitive...

{Abstract}: Over the prior few years, reversible physical or chemical modifications that are performed in response to external stimuli have garnered considerable amount of attention. These systems' quick responses to stimuli like pH, light, temperature, enzymes, voltage, pressure, electrical and magnetic fields have allowed the development and design of multifunctional materials with novel pathways. Electrochemical responses can be seen easily in chemical moieties (specially metallocene) due to changes in the electron's participation in the reactions. Among all these systems, ferrocene (Fc) and its derivatives have been significantly exploited with a variety of host molecules. The customizable mechanical strengths of the various host-guest inclusions, such as cyclodextrins, pillararenes, and calixarenes, etc., are made possible by the regulated redox response of the Fc moiety in conjunction with pH control. The primary focus of the present study is based on current systematic research on Fc-based supramolecular system du...

{Abstract}: Polyoxometalate (POM)-containing supramolecular assemblies possess multiply stimuli-responsiveness, and are important for developing intelligent materials. To date, though hydrogen bonding, host-guest interaction and coordination bond have been applied to construct hybrid assembly, it is still emergent to introduce more driving forces such as charge-transfer interaction, which can bring new structural and functional features. Herein, a pyrene-modified Anderson-type POM bearing sodium cations is synthesized, and possesses good solubility in water, which is used to combine with 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene (TCNB). The prepared hybrid shows a one-dimensional hybrid structure via the charge-transfer interaction between pyrene and TCNB, which is verified by various technological measurements. By utilizing the attraction between polyanionic cluster and alkaline amino acid, l-/D-arginine can be imported into the system, resulting in the chiral induction of the hybrid assembly, which cannot be seen in each individual co...

Moreover, excellent optical properties in different solvents were shown by the fluorescence spectra of SPy. It was further shown that SPy could not only detect the water content in organic solvents, but also exhibit potential applications in the field of white-light emission materials and anti-counterfeiting.

{Abstract}: Since phenolic pollutants and organic dyes do great harm to the environment and human health, it is necessary to explore efficient and low-cost methods to monitor and adsorb them respectively. Herein, a multivalent supramolecular assembly composed of triphenylamine derivatives (TPAN) and nor-seco-cucurbit[10]uril (ns-Q[10]) was designed and synthesized. The supramolecular assembly has a luminescent core and cationic N-methyl imidazole groups connected by alkyl chains, and triphenylamine derivatives (TPAN) can be combined with ns-Q[10] in a stoichiometric ratio of 2:3 to form a network multivalent assembly with yellow fluorescence enhancement. At the same time, this supramolecular assembly has been applied to supramolecular recognition of 4-Hydroxyphthalonitrile (4-HP) and Eosin Y (ESY), and it can also adsorb and remove ESY in aqueous solution. This shows that the multivalent supramolecular assembly shows good potential in industrial applications such as the emission of phenolic pollutants and the adsorption ...

{Abstract}: The assembly of conjugated organic molecules from solution to solid-state plays a critical role in determining the thin film morphology and optoelectronic properties of solution-processed organic electronics and photovoltaics. During evaporative solution processing, π-conjugated systems can assemble via various forms of intermolecular interactions, forming distinct aggregate structures that can drastically tune the charge transport landscape in the solid-state. In blend systems composed of donor polymer and acceptor molecules, assembly of neat materials couples with phase separation and crystallization processes, leading to complex phase transition pathways which govern the blend film morphology. In this review, we provide an in-depth review of molecular assembly processes in neat conjugated polymers and nonfullerene small molecule acceptors and discuss their impact on the thin film morphology and optoelectronic properties. We then shift our focus to blend systems relevant to organic solar cells and discuss t...

{Abstract}: Chiral supramolecular assemblies with helical structures (e.g., proteins with α-helix, DNA with double helix, collagen with triple-helix) as the central structure motifs in biological systems play a crucial role in various physiological activities of living organisms. Variations in chiral structure can cause many abnormal physiological activities. To gain insight into the construction, structural transition, and related physiological functions of these complex helix in natural systems, it is necessary to fabricate artificial supramolecular assemblies with controllable helix orientation as research platform. This review discusses recent advances in chiral supramolecular assembly, including the precise construction and regulation of assembled chiral nanostructures with tunable chirality. Chiral structure-dependent biological activities, including cell proliferation, cell differentiation, antibacterial activity and tissue regeneration, are also discussed. This review not only contributes to further understanding...

{Abstract}: In the last decade, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become an essential tool to investigate the molecular properties of membrane trafficking processes, often in conjunction with experimental approaches. The combination of MD simulations with recent developments in structural biology, such as cryo-electron microscopy and artificial intelligence-based structure determination, opens new, exciting possibilities for future investigations. However, the full potential of MD simulations to provide a molecular view of the complex and dynamic processes involving membrane trafficking can only be realized if certain limitations are addressed, and especially those concerning the quality of coarse-grain models, which, despite recent successes in describing large-scale systems, still suffer from far-from-ideal chemical accuracy. In this review, we will highlight recent success stories of MD simulations in the investigation of membrane trafficking processes, their implications for future research, and the challenges...

Azo的加入会降低P2VP的玻璃化转变温度，提高P2VP嵌段的体积分数，从而导致复合物自组装结构发生层状到六方柱状再到体心立方结构的转变.而当Azo摩尔比>0.5时，Azo自身聚集比较严重，相分离结构变得无序.后续研究将关注偶氮苯分子构象变化调控薄膜态自组装结构取向行为.

{Abstract}: The present study developed an efficient fluorescent approach, based on a supramolecular assembly between gold nanoclusters and calix[4]arene derivatives (C4A-Ds), to detect sever pollutant of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). For that, a series of C4A-Ds with different chain lengths and positive charges at the wider rim were designed and synthesized. Cytidine-5' phosphate protected gold nanoclusters (AuNCs@CMP) were then assembled with calix[4]arene (LC4AP) to form AuNCs/LC4AP assembly, leading to 8-fold luminescence enhancement via the AIEE effect. However, further binding with PFOS reconstituted the as-formed assembly hrough a competitive effect, generating a fluorescence quenching. Particularly, the linear fluorescence response of AuNCs/LC4AP to PFOS realized a highly sensitive determination of the pollutant PFOS in a wide range (2.0-100 μM). In addition, the developed method successfully detected PFOS in pool water near a fire drill field, being good enough for the practical PFOS determination. The c...

{Abstract}: Spinal cord injury (SCI) can result in irreversible motor and sensory deficits. However, up to data, clinical first-line drugs have ambiguous benefits and debilitating side effects, mainly due to the insufficient accumulation, poor physiological barrier penetration, and lack of spatio-temporal controlled release at lesion tissue. Herein, we proposed a supramolecular assemblies composed of hyperbranched polymer-formed core/shell structure through host-guest interactions. Such HPAA-BM@CD-HPG-C assemblies co-loaded with p38 inhibitor (SB203580) and insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1) are able to achieve time- and space-programmed sequential delivery benefiting from their cascaded responsiveness. The core-shell disassembly of HPAA-BM@CD-HPG-C occurs in acidic micro-environment around lesion, achieving preferentially the burst release of IGF-1 to protect survival neurons. Subsequently, the HPAA-BM cores containing SB203580 are endocytosed by the recruited macrophages and degraded by intracellular GSH, accelerating...

{Abstract}: 本文合成了一种单链的非离子型rod-coil两亲分子TriBAzoEO,分子中的偶氮苯基团和聚氧乙烯醚头基分别赋予其对光和热的响应性. TriBAzoEO降低表面张力的能力有限,但在水溶液中会形成蠕虫状胶束.其浓度越高,蠕虫状胶束越长,体系的黏度越大.紫外光激发可将TriBAzoEO中的偶氮苯从反式变为顺式构型,诱导蠕虫状胶束向球形胶束的转变,但可见光激发不能实现逆转变过程,这可能与聚集体中顺式TriBAzoEO分子间存在较强的π-π相互作用及较大的空间位阻有关. TriBAzoEO水溶液具备热增稠现象,这种热可逆转变由聚氧乙烯醚头基与水分子间氢键作用的变化所引起.升温会削弱氢键而降低TriBAzoEO的亲水性,促进更大结构蠕虫状胶束的形成而导致热增稠;降温后TriBAzoEO的亲水性增强,蠕虫状胶束结构恢复,体系的黏度降低.

{Abstract}: Innovative modes of response can greatly push forward chemical sensing processes and subsequently improve sensing performance. Classical chemical sensing modes seldom involve the transition of a delicate molecular assembly during the response. Here, we display a sensing mode for polyamine detection based on an order-order transition of iron-sulfur complexes upon their assembly. Strong validation proves that the unique order-order transition of the assemblies is the driving force of the response, in which the polyamine captures the metal ion of the iron-sulfur complex, leading it to decompose into a metal-polyamine product, accompanied by an order-order transition of the assemblies. This mechanism makes the detection process more intuitive and selective, and remarkably improves the detection efficiency, achieving excellent polyamines specificity, second-level response, convenient visual detection, and good recyclability of the sensing system. Furthermore, this paper also provides opportunities for the further ...

{Abstract}: Achieving rapid global agricultural development while maintaining ecological harmony is a major challenge of the new millennium. Meeting this challenge requires the development of efficient and environmentally friendly agrochemicals, including pesticides and fertilizers. Molecular assembly, as a promising strategy, has garnered significant attention in recent years for the development of advanced solid-state forms of agrochemicals. In this review, we present the potential and recent advancements of solid-state forms, such as polymorphs, cocrystals/salts, solvates, inclusion compounds, and the amorphous state, for the production of high-efficiency and low-polluting agrochemical products. We provide an overview of the concepts and preparation methods of these solid-state forms, followed by an exploration of their applications in sustainable agriculture. Specifically, we highlight their value in enhancing pesticide solubility, enabling controlled release of chemical fertilizers, and reducing off-target risks. La...

{Abstract}: Triphenylmethane (trityl) group has been recognized as a supramolecular synthon in crystal engineering, molecular machine rotors and stereochemical chirality inductors in materials science. Herein we demonstrate for the first time how it can be utilized in the domain of molecular magnetic materials through shaping of single molecule magnet (SMM) properties within the lanthanide complexes in tandem with other non-covalent interactions. Trityl-appended mono- (HL1) and bis-compartmental (HL2) hydrazone ligands were synthesized and complexated with Dy(III) and Er(III) triflate and nitrate salts to generate four monometallic (1-4) and two bimetallic (5, 6) complexes. The static and dynamic magnetic properties of 1-6 were investigated, revealing that only ligand HL1 induces assemblies (1-4) capable of showing SMM behaviour, with Dy(III) congeners (1, 2) able to exhibit the phenomenon also under zero field conditions. Theoretical ab initio studies helped in determination of Dy(III) energetic levels, magnetic anisotr...

{Abstract}: The effect of the cross-linking mechanism and functional properties of soy glycinin (11S)-potato starch (PS) complexes was investigated in this study. The results showed that the binding effecting and spatial network structure of 11S-PS complexes via heated-induced cross-linking were adjusted by biopolymer ratios. In particular, 11S-PS complexes with the biopolymer ratios of 2:15, had a strongest intermolecular interaction through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic force. Moreover, 11S-PS complexes at the biopolymer ratios of 2:15 exhibited a finer three-dimensional network structure, which was used as film-forming solution to enhance the barrier performance and mitigate the exposure to the environment. In addition, the 11S-PS complexes coating was effective in moderating the loss of nutrients, thereby extending their storage life in truss tomato preservation experiments. This study provides helpful to insights into the cross-linking mechanism of the 11S-PS complexes and the potential application of food-grade bi...

{Abstract}: A series of new π‐conjugated macrocycles (AzoM‐n‐E, n = 1–3) incorporating azobenzene units have been synthesized by a facile strategy in one‐pot reaction. The resultant azobenzene‐embedded macrocycles feature intrinsic photoresponsive behaviors and intriguing supramolecular assembling properties. The smallest macrocycle AzoM‐1‐E with a rigid planar conjugated backbone structure is used to prepare the single crystal transistors, showing reversible optical tunability. The moderate size macrocycle AzoM‐2‐E assembles into a dimer in the form of interpenetration through π‐π stacking between azobenzene units. The largest macrocycle AzoM‐3‐E with enhanced flexibility can adaptively assemble with various types of electron‐deficient guests accompanied by distortion of azobenzene. Typically, AzoM‐3‐E assembles with the planar F4‐TCNQ to form a tetragonal geometry by C‐F···π and π‐π interactions, while the assembly with ellipsoidal C70 via π‐π interactions induces AzoM‐3‐E to form a boat‐shaped geometry.

{Abstract}: Pillar[n]arenes usually form 1:1 host–guest complexes with guest molecules. However, unique host–guest properties appear by the formation of new structures, such as tubular dimers, nanotubes, boxes, and end-capped cavitands. In addition, crystalline pillar[5]arenes show unique host–guest properties, such as gate opening, encapsulation of a guest molecule by two pillar[5]arene wheels, and quantitative uptake of alkane guest molecules. Therefore, cooperative binding of guest molecules to pillar[n]arene assemblies is the key to achieve unique host–guest behavior. Pillar[n]arenes show planar chirality owing to their shape, and thus coupling between the planar chirality and host–guest property enables planar chiral inversion, memory, and erasure. In this review, we discuss the diversity, functionality, and supramolecular chirality of host–guest pillar[n]arene assemblies.

GBA has inter-ionic, intraionic and intermolecular hydrogen bondings giving a three-dimensional supramolecular assembly. The carboxylate ion is present in the resonance form with C–O distances of 1.242 and 1.246 Å in GBA, whereas the C–O distances being 1.262 and 1.245 Å in BABA. In BABA, an inverted dimer with inter-ionic hydrogen bonding exist as a dimer with supramolecular assembly due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the ion pairs. So the counter cation decides the resonance form of the carboxylate ion, hydrogen-bonding network and the disposition of the phenyl rings in the benzilate and benzyl moiety. The IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral data have been interpreted using the crystal structure data and by the comparison between the two similar derivatives. Both the compounds show the formation of the ammonium benzilate or methylammonium benzilate moiety ...

{Abstract}: The successful preparation of supramolecular block copolymers (SBCPs) by living supramolecular assembly technology requires two kinetic systems in which both the seed (nucleus) and heterogenous monomer providers are in non-equilibrium. However, employing simple monomers to construct the SBCPs via this technology is almost impossible because the low spontaneous nucleation barrier of simple molecules prevents the formation of kinetic states. Here, with the help of confinement from layered double hydroxide (LDH), various simple monomers successfully form living supramolecular co-assemblies (LSCA). LDH overcomes a considerable energy barrier to obtain living seeds to support the growth of the inactivated second monomer. The ordered LDH topology is sequentially mapped to the seed, second monomer, and binding sites. Thus, the multidirectional binding sites are endowed with the ability to branch, making the branch length of dendritic LSCA reach its maximum value of 3.5 cm so far. The strategy of universality will gu...

{Abstract}: Herein, we demonstrate the supramolecular assemblies from a bifunctional ligand on Au(111), towards engineering two-dimensional (metal-) organic multilevel nanostructures. The bifunctional ligand employed, including two Br atoms and one carboxylic terminal, offers multiple bonding motifs with different configurations and binding energies. These bonding motifs are highly self-selective and self-recognizable, and thus afford the formation of subunits that contribute to engineering multilevel self-assemblies. Our scanning tunneling microscopy experiments, in combination with the density functional theory calculations, revealed various hydrogen, halogen and alkali-carboxylate bonding motifs dictating the different levels of the assemblies. The multilevel assembly protocol based on a judicious choice of multiple bonding motifs guarantees a deliberate control of surface-confined (metal-) organic nanostructures. Our findings may present new opportunities for the fabrication of complex two-dimensional (metal-) organi...

{Abstract}: Specific discrimination of cancer from inflammation and normal tissue at the same time simply and sensitively, is of great significance for the diagnosis of cancer and the improvement of patient survival. Hence, we present the design of a targeted supramolecular fluorescent nanoprobe (SFNP) and modulate its supramolecular interaction between different functional modules via host-guest chemistry for identification of lung adenocarcinoma cancer from inflammation. Aptamer-targeted SFNP (SFNP-Aptamer) for recognition of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and folate-targeted SFNP (SFNP-Folate) for folate receptor recognition of activated macrophages in inflamed lesions, can be facilely fabricated just by modulating inter-module interactions. The supramolecular ensemble composed of SFNP-Aptamer and SFNP-Folate can not only specifically distinguish lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, activated macrophages and normal cells, but also successfully distinguish lung adenocarcinoma tissue, inflammatory tissue and normal tis...

{Abstract}: Hydrogen-bonded supramolecular assemblies of citric acid, CA, with some heterocyclic compounds (N-donor and N-oxide)-acridine (acr), phenazine (phenz), 1,10-phenanthroline (110phen), 1,7-phenanthroline (17phen), 4,7-phenanthroline (47phen), 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (dabco), and 4,4'-bipyridyl-N,N'-dioxide (bpydo)-have been reported. Among these, only the N-donors phenz and N-oxide (bpydo) form neutral co-crystals, while the others form salts owing to the deprotonation of -COOH. Thus, depending on the nature of the aggregate (salt/co-crystal), recognition between the co-formers is established through O-H···N/N+-H···O/N+H···O-heteromeric hydrogen bonding. Additionally, CA molecules establish homomeric interactions mediated by O-H···O hydrogen bonds. Moreover, CA forms a cyclic network with the co-formers or on its own, with a noteworthy feature of formation of host-guest networks in the assemblies with acr and phenz (solvated). In the assembly of acr, the CA molecules form ...

{Abstract}: Homochiral supramolecular assembly (HSA) based on achiral molecules has provided important clues to understand the origin of biological homochirality from the aspect of symmetry breaking. However, planar achiral molecules still face the challenge of forming HSA due to the lack of driving force for twisted stacking, which is a prerequisite for homochirality. Here, with the benefit of the formation of 2D intercalated layered double hydroxide (LDH, host-guest nanomaterials) in vortex motion, planar achiral guest molecules can form the chiral units with spatially asymmetrical structure in the confinement space of LDH. Once the LDH is removed, these chiral units are in a thermodynamic non-equilibrium state, which can be amplified to HSA by self-replicating. Especially, the homochiral bias can be predicted in advance by controlling the vortex direction. Therefore, this study breaks the bottleneck of complicated molecular design and provides a new technology to achieve HSA made of planar achiral molecules with defin...

{Abstract}: The assembly of supramolecular structures within living systems is an innovative approach for introducing artificial constructs and developing bio-materials capable of influencing and/or regulating the biological responses of living organisms. By integrating chemical, photophysical, morphological, and structural characterizations, we show that the cell-driven assembly of DTTO into fibers results in the formation of a "biological assisted" polymorphic form, hence the term bio-polymorph. Indeed, X-ray diffraction revealed that cell-grown DTTO fibers present a unique molecular packing leading to specific morphological, optical, and electrical properties. Monitoring the process of fibers formation in cells with time-resolved photoluminescence, we established that cellular machinery is necessary for fibers production and postulated a non-classical nucleation (NCC) mechanism for their growth. These biomaterials may have disruptive applications in the stimulation and sensing of living cells, but more crucially, the ...

{Abstract}: Artificial photosynthesis is an attractive strategy for converting solar energy into fuels, largely because the Earth receives enough solar energy in one hour to meet humanity’s energy needs for an entire year. However, developing devices for artificial photosynthesis remains difficult and requires computational approaches to guide and assist the interpretation of experiments. In this Perspective, we discuss current and future computational approaches, as well as the challenges of designing and characterizing molecular assemblies that absorb solar light, transfer electrons between interfaces, and catalyze water-splitting and fuel-forming reactions.

{Abstract}: ConspectusStereochemical control of excited-state asymmetric photoreactions has been one of the most challenging topics of modern photochemistry. The short-lived character of electronically excited photosubstrates and their low activation energy barriers to form both enantiomers are the major obstacles to achieving significant enantioselectivity in excited-state asymmetric photochemistry. Recent research demonstrated that the supramolecular strategy is promising to control the stereochemical outcome of asymmetric photoreaction through relatively strong and long-lasting noncovalent interaction at both ground and excited states. In this methodology, chiral hosts/assemblies provide the chiral environment for photochemically transferring chirality to the complexed photosubstrate in both the ground and the excited states by virtue of relatively strong supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, π-π, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions. The orientation and conformation of the photo...

{Abstract}: Rational integration of native enzymes and nanoscaffold is an efficient means to access robust biocatalyst, yet remains on-going challenges due to the trade-off between fragile enzymes and harsh assembling conditions. Here, we report a supramolecular strategy enabling the in situ fusion of fragile enzymes into a robust porous crystal. A c2-symmetric pyrene tecton with four formic acid arms is utilized as the building block to engineer this hybrid biocatalyst. The decorated formic acid arms afford the pyrene tectons high dispersibility in minute amount of organic solvent, and permit the hydrogen-bonded linkage of discrete pyrene tectons to an extended supramolecular network around an enzyme in almost organic solvent-free aqueous solution. This hybrid biocatalyst is covered by long-range ordered pore channels, which can serve as the gating to sieve the catalytic substrate and thus enhance the biocatalytic selectivity. Given the structural integration, a supramolecular biocatalyst-based electrochemical immunosen...

{Abstract}: Stem cell-based therapies have demonstrated significant potential for use in heart regeneration. An effective paradigm for heart repair in rodent and large animal models is the transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Despite this, the functional and phenotypical immaturity of two-dimensional (2D)-cultured hiPSC-CMs, particularly their low electrical integration, poses a caveat for clinical translation. In this study, a supramolecular assembly of a glycopeptide containing a cell adhesion motif-RGD and saccharide-glucose (Bio-Gluc-RGD) was designed to enable the three-dimensional (3D) spheroid formation of hiPSC-CMs, promoting cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions that occur during spontaneous morphogenesis. HiPSC-CMs in spheroids were prone to be phenotypically mature and developed robust gap junctions via activation of the integrin/ILK/p-AKT/Gata4 pathway. Monodispersed hiPSC-CMs encapsulated in the Bio-Gluc-RGD hydrogel were more likely to form aggregates a...

{Abstract}: Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) represent an interface between microbial cells and aquatic environment, where nanoplastics acquire coatings to alter their fate and toxicity. However, little is known about molecular interactions governing modification of nanoplastics at biological interfaces. Molecular dynamics simulations combining experiments were conducted to investigate assembly of EPS and its regulatory roles in the aggregation of differently charged nanoplastics and interactions with bacterial membrane. Driven by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, EPS formed micelle-like supramolecular structures with hydrophobic core and amphiphilic exterior. Different components, depending on their hydrophobicity and charge, were found to promote or suppress EPS assembly. Neutral and hydrophobic nanoplastics showed unbiased adsorption of EPS species, while cationic and anionic nanoplastics were distinct and attracted specific molecules of opposite charges. Compared with isolated EPS, assembled EPS con...

{Abstract}: Molecular self‐assembly has significant potential in the field of sensing. Polydiacetylenes (PDAs) are conjugated polymers possessing peculiar optical properties obtained by photopolymerization of self‐assembled diacetylene monomers. Herein, the blue‐to‐red phase transition upon either thermal stimulus or interaction with cyclodextrins (CDs) of two PDAs, bearing either carboxylic (PCDA) or amino (PCDA‐NH2) polar heads, is investigated to develop a colorimetric sensor for food phenolic antioxidants. The change in the PDA polar head does not affect significantly thermo‐chromatic transition. Upon thermal stimulus, in both PDAs, color transition occurs straightforward between two distinct stable states and does not involve the disordering of the PDA crystal phase, as revealed by UV–vis spectroscopy and SAXS analysis. Contrarily, PDA/α‐CD interaction is influenced by intermolecular forces among PDA polar heads and is more efficient for PCDA. α‐CDs presumably cause changes in both PDA backbone conformati...

{Abstract}: We discuss the design, development, and evaluation of an Orbitrap/time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS)-based instrument with integrated UV photodissociation (UVPD) and time/mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)-resolved imaging for the comprehensive study of the higher-order molecular structure of macromolecular assemblies (MMAs). A bespoke TOF analyzer has been coupled to the higher-energy collisional dissociation cell of an ultrahigh mass range hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap MS. A 193 nm excimer laser was employed to photofragment MMA ions. A combination of microchannel plates (MCPs)-Timepix (TPX) quad and MCPs-phosphor screen-TPX3CAM assemblies have been used as axial and orthogonal imaging detectors, respectively. The instrument can operate in four different modes, where the UVPD-generated fragment ions from the native MMA ions can be measured with high-mass resolution or imaged in a mass-resolved manner to reveal the relative positions of the UVPD fragments postdissociation. This information is intended to be ut...

{Abstract}: Biomedical materials with outstanding biochemical and mechanical properties have great potential in tissue engineering, drug delivery, antibacterial, and implantable devices. Hydrogels have emerged as a most promising family of biomedical materials because of their high water content, low modulus, biomimetic network structures, and versatile biofunctionalities. It is critical to design and synthesize biomimetic and biofunctional hydrogels to meet demands of biomedical applications. Moreover, fabrication of hydrogel-based biomedical devices and scaffolds remains a great challenge, largely due to the poor processibility of the crosslinked networks. Supramolecular microgels have emerged as building blocks for fabrication of biofunctional materials for biomedical applications due to their excellent characteristics, including softness, micron size, high porosity, heterogeneity and degradability. Moreover, microgels can serve as vehicles to carry drugs, bio-factors, and even cells to augment the biofunctionalities ...

{Abstract}: 抄録(#br)We report the design of pyrene-substituted azobenzene chromophores and their assembly into flat aggregates capable of repeated switching of their absorption and emission properties in response to light and heat. The introduction of a relatively longer butoxy linker between the pyrene and azobenzene (AzBuPy) resulted in the production of more than 90% of cis-azobenzene at the photostationary state of ultraviolet (UV) light, as determined by UV-visible absorption and 1H NMR spectral data. Flat petal-shaped micrometer-sized structures formed in highly polar DMF-H2O mixtures did not experience severe disassembly even after sufficient UV light irradiation, and showed excellent photoswitching performance. In addition, we investigated light and heat responses of DPA@AzBuPy aggregates assembled from hydrophobic fluorophore (9,10-diphenylanthracene: DPA) and AzBuPy mixtures.

{Abstract}: 氧化镍（NiOx）作为无机p型半导体，常用于倒置钙钛矿太阳能电池（PSCs）中的空穴传输层（HTL），但本身存在的高缺陷密度和与钙钛矿不相匹配的能级排布限制了PSCs的能量转换效率。本文通过引入双自组装单分子层修饰氧化镍界面，钝化氧化镍材料自身缺陷，改善能级匹配，促进了界面处光生载流子的提取和传输，提高了PSCs的开路电压（Voc）和填充因子（FF），最终将刮涂氧化镍基PSCs的效率提升到20.38%，而且未封装的器件在氮气氛围中用85℃老化1 000 h后仍维持原始效率的96%。更重要的是，我们以此制备了孔径面积为60.84 cm2、由13节子电池串联而成的钙钛矿组件，效率达到了17.04%。

{Abstract}: We report a simplistic approach that employs complexation between poly(N-allylglycine) modified with 3-mercaptoacetic acid (PNAG-COOH) and a series of metal ions to construct a new type of supramolecular architecture with intriguing features that enable a versatile and advanced nanoplatform. In most cases, such complexation results in nanoscale vesicles with superior stability, which differs significantly from the precipitates of conventional carbon-chain polymers and polypeptides. We attribute this to the polar tertiary amide groups in the polypeptoid backbone that offer excellent water affinity and numerous noncovalent molecular interactions. Particularly, the PNAG-COOH/Fe2+ complex can generate reactive oxygen species via a Fenton reaction in the presence of H2O2, thus causing ferroptosis selectively in the tumor cell. In addition, a H2O2-modulated intracellular in situ morphology transition enables prompt release of doxorubicin, representing a synergi...

{Abstract}: The recently synthesized novel figure-of-eight nanohoop with two strained oligoparaphenylenes (OPPs) was theoretically designed to collect and stabilize new allotropic carbon cyclo[18]carbon (C18) through molecular assembly. The size adaptability and shape complementarity of C18 to OPP make it possible for them to combine into extraordinary ring-in-ring supramolecules. Thermodynamic analysis of 2C18@OPP showed that the host-guest complex should spontaneously form below 404 K. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated that the assembly of C18 and OPP into host-guest complexes of up to 1 : 2 can occur at ambient temperature. Various real-space function analyses revealed that the nature of the non-covalent interaction between C18 and OPP is the van der Waals (vdW) attraction characterized by π-π stacking. Photoexcitation makes the host-guest complexes less stable in their S1 state by causing the central linker to flatten.

{Abstract}: 本文通过全原子分子动力学研究了典型的自组装芳香二肽分子(z-FF)自组装过程的微观结构演化,探索了肽分子间以及肽分子与溶剂水分子的微观作用力在自组装各个阶段的作用.模拟结果显示,尽管π-π堆积作用占分子间作用能的比重不高,但其在自组装初期对分子聚集起到的驱动力的贡献大于非π-π堆积作用力.肽分子与溶剂水分子形成的氢键数量随着组装进程而减少,总体呈现去溶剂化效应,但同时伴随着多次再溶剂化过程.水化层中的水分子存在两种特殊的“水桥”形式,即“单分子水桥”和“水团簇水桥”,其在水化层水分子中占比在30%～70%之间涨落.水桥的涨落伴随着肽分子结构重排,在自组装各个阶段(相分离、成核、生长和纤维交联)起着重要作用.

{Abstract}: Synthesis of buckybowls have stayed highly challenging due to the large structural strain caused by curved π surface. In this paper, we report the synthesis and properties of two trichalcogenasupersumanenes which three chalcogen (sulfur or selenium) atoms and three methylene groups bridge at the bay regions of hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene. These trichalcogenasupersumanenes are synthesized quickly in three steps using an Aldol cyclotrimerization, a Scholl oxidative cyclization, and a Stille type reaction. X-ray crystallography analysis reveals that they encompass bowl diameters of 11.06 Å and 11.35 Å and bowl depths of 2.29 Å and 2.16 Å for the trithiasupersumanene and triselenosupersumanene, respectively. Furthermore, trithiasupersumanene derivative with methyl chains can form host-guest complexes with C60 or C70, which are driven by concave-convex π ⋯ π interactions and multiple C-H ⋯ π interactions between bowl and fullerenes.

{Abstract}: In living systems, the formation of structures relies on balancing kinetic and thermodynamic influences powered by reversible covalent bond chemistry. Although synthetic efforts have replicated these processes to some extent, elucidating their combination is necessary to identify mechanisms that confer nature’s structural precision and flexibility within a complex environment. Here we design a photolytic reaction cascade where competing redox pathways control the transience, interconversion and production rates of thiol/disulfide supramolecular monomers in situ. In contrast to direct assembly by dissolution, cascade generation of the same monomers formed hierarchical assemblies with different structural order. Redox-induced cycling between thiol–disulfide formation led to the emergence of new secondary structures and chirality within the final assemblies. These multiple structural states found within the same molecular system demonstrate the concept of assembly plasticity engaged frequently in biology. We dem...

{Abstract}: The pentavalent meglumine antimoniate (MA) is still a first-line drug in the treatment of leishmaniasis in several countries. As an attempt to elucidate its mechanism of action and develop new antimonial drugs with improved therapeutic profile, Sb(V) complexes with different ligands, including β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), nucleosides and non-ionic surfactants, have been studied. Interestingly, Sb(V) oxide, MA, its complex with β-CD, Sb(V)-guanosine complex and amphiphilic Sb(V) complexes with N-alkyl-N-methylglucamide, have shown marked tendency to self-assemble in aqueous solutions, forming nanoaggregates, hydrogel or micelle-like nanoparticles. Surprisingly, the resulting assemblies presented in most cases slow dissociation kinetics upon dilution and a strong influence of pH, which impacted on their pharmacokinetic and therapeutic properties against leishmaniasis. To explain this unique property, we raised the hypothesis that multiple pnictogen bonds could contribute to the formation of these assemblies and their...

{Abstract}: Life emerges from thousands of biochemical processes occurring within a shared intracellular environment. We have gained deep insights from in vitro reconstitution of isolated biochemical reactions. However, the reaction medium in test tubes is typically simple and diluted. The cell interior is far more complex: macromolecules occupy more than a third of the space, and energy-consuming processes agitate the cell interior. Here, we review how this crowded, active environment impacts the motion and assembly of macromolecules, with an emphasis on mesoscale particles (10-1000 nm diameter). We describe methods to probe and analyze the biophysical properties of cells and highlight how changes in these properties can impact physiology and signaling, and potentially contribute to aging, and diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration.

{Abstract}: Despite their clinical success, Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are still limited to the delivery of a handful of cytotoxic small-molecule payloads. Adaptation of this successful format to the delivery of alternative types of cytotoxic payloads is of high interest in the search for novel anticancer treatments. Herein, we considered that the inherent toxicity of cationic nanoparticles (cNP), which limits their use as oligonucleotide delivery systems, could be turned into an opportunity to access a new family of toxic payloads. We complexed anti-HER2 antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates (AOC) with cytotoxic cationic polydiacetylenic micelles to obtain Antibody-Toxic-Nanoparticles Conjugates (ATNPs) and studied their physicochemical properties, as well as their bioactivity in both in vitro and in vivo HER2 models. After optimising their AOC/cNP ratio, the small (73 nm) HER2-targeting ATNPs were found to selectively kill antigen-positive SKBR-2 cells over antigen-negative MDA-MB-231 cells in serum-containing mediu...

{Abstract}: To study the effect of solvent on supramolecular self-assembly behaviors, a chiral courmarin-substituted glutamine amphiphile, L/DG-Cm, was synthesized for investigation. It was found that L/DG-Cm self-assembled into short nanotubes in toluene, while it formed longer nanotubes together with an obvious helix nanobelt structure for L/DG-Cm in DMSO, demonstrating that the nanotubes were formed by nanobelt rolling. The CD and CPL spectra revealed the same chiral property of the L/DG-Cm assemblies formed in toluene and DMSO. Theoretical calculations revealed that LG-Cm was prone to forming similar dimer structures in both DMSO and toluene. However, the distinct hierarchical packing ways in toluene and DMSO led to different nanostructures and chiroptical properties. Based on the temperature-dependent UV-visible and CD spectrometric measurements, LG-Cm was observed to aggregate in different supramolecular self-assembly modes, which was the cooperative (nucleation-elongation) mechanism in toluene and the isodesmic mo...

{Abstract}: Histidine methylation serves as an intriguing strategy to introduce altered traits of target proteins, including metal ion chelation, histidine-based catalysis, molecular assembly, and translation regulation. As a newly identified histidine methyltransferase, METTL9 catalyzes N1-methylation of protein substrates containing the “His-x-His” motif (HxH, x denotes small side chain residue). Here our structural and biochemical studies revealed that METTL9 specifically methylates the second histidine of the “HxH” motif, while exploiting the first one as a recognition signature. We observed an intimate engagement between METTL9 and a pentapeptide motif, where the small “x” residue is embedded and confined within the substrate pocket. Upon complex formation, the N3 atom of histidine imidazole ring is stabilized by an aspartate residue such that the N1 atom is presented to S-adenosylmethionine for methylation. Moreover, METTL9 displayed a feature in preferred consecutive and “C-to-N” directional methylation of tandem ...

{Abstract}: The Rpd3L histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex is an ancient 12-subunit complex conserved in a broad range of eukaryotes that performs localized deacetylation at or near sites of recruitment by DNA-bound factors. Here we describe the cryo-EM structure of this prototypical HDAC complex that is characterized by as many as seven subunits performing scaffolding roles for the tight integration of the only catalytic subunit, Rpd3. The principal scaffolding protein, Sin3, along with Rpd3 and the histone chaperone, Ume1, are present in two copies, with each copy organized into separate lobes of an asymmetric dimeric molecular assembly. The active site of one Rpd3 is completely occluded by a leucine side chain of Rxt2, while the tips of the two lobes and the more peripherally associated subunits exhibit varying levels of flexibility and positional disorder. The structure reveals unexpected structural homology/analogy between unrelated subunits in the fungal and mammalian complexes and provides a foundation for deeper in...

{Abstract}: Both nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) and heavy metal ions are accumulative high-risk environmental pollutants, so high-sensitivity detection of these environment pollutants is necessary. In this work, a cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) based luminescent supramolecular assembly [Na2K2(CB[6])2(DMF)2(ANS)(H2O)4](1) (CB[6] = cucurbit[6]uril, ANS2- = 8-Aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid ion) has been synthesized under solvothermal conditions, using ANS2- as a structural inducer. Performance studies have shown that 1 exhibits excellent chemical stability and easy regeneration ability. It can highly selective sensing of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) through fluorescence quenching with a strong quenching constant (Ksv = 2.58 × 104 M−1). Additionally, the fluorescence emission of 1 can be effectively enhanced with Ba2+ in aqueous solution (Ksv = 5.57 × 103 M−1). More impressively, Ba2+@1 was successfully used as anti-counterfeiting fluores...

{Abstract}: The application of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is promising in environmental monitoring. Developing an emerging design strategy to expand the class of COF-based ECL luminophores is highly desirable. Here, a COF-based host-guest system was constructed through guest molecular assembly to deal with nuclear contamination analysis. The efficient charge transport network was formed by inserting an electron-withdrawing guest tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) into the open space of the COF host (TP-TBDA; TP = 2,4,6-trihydroxy-1,3,5-benzenetricarbaldehyde and TBDA = 2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzene-1,4-diamine) with an electron-donating property; the construction of the COF-based host-guest system (TP-TBDA@TCNQ) triggered the ECL emission of non-emitting TP-TBDA. Furthermore, the dense active sites in TP-TBDA were utilized to capture the target substance UO22+. The presence of UO22+ broke the charge-transfer effect in TP-TBDA@TCNQ, resultin...

{Abstract}: Mimicking the structure of proteins using synthetic polymers requires building blocks with structural similarity and the use of various noncovalent and dynamic covalent interactions. We report the synthesis of helical poly(isocyanide)s bearing diaminopyridine and pyridine side-chains and the multistep functionalization of the polymers' side-chains using hydrogen bonding and metal coordination. The orthogonality of the hydrogen bonding and metal coordination was proved by varying the sequence of the multistep assembly. The two side-chain functionalizations are reversible through the use of competitive solvents and/or competing ligands. Throughout the assembly and disassembly, the helical conformation of the polymer backbone is sustained as proved by circular dichroism spectroscopy. These results open the possibility to incorporate helical domains into complex polymer architectures and create a helical scaffold for smart materials.

{Abstract}: Imines are frequently used as valuable intermediates in organic transformation and pharmaceutical synthesis. Conventional imine synthesis includes Lewis acid catalysts, dehydrating agents, and unstable aldehydes. Developing eco‐friendly molecular assembly techniques has become increasingly important in recent years. In particular, there is a significant need for methods that recycle resources and have high atomic efficiency with minimal environmental impact. Oxidative synthesis of imines from amines has been investigated in presence of molecular oxygen (or air) which is readily accessible on Earth. The closely linked catalysts have been classified into metals, bio‐inspired, and MOF catalysts. Highly active, affordable, and adaptable copper based catalysts are given special attention here, some critical elements that influence reaction processes and catalytic activity are also displayed in the present study. The modern methods along with mechanistic routes for converting primary amines to imines using copper c...

{Abstract}: Developing practical optical materials with strong third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) responses attracts increasing attention. Efforts in this area extend to the activation of appropriate materials and the magnification of their low NLO responses. Herein, we propose a stepwise assembly-amplification strategy to enhance the NLO responses of low NLO-active metal sulfide clusters. Through a self-assembly process, W/Cu/S cluster-based tetrahedral and octahedral cages are successfully obtained, both exhibiting weak NLO responses in solution that are not apparent for the unassembled components. Their incorporation into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), followed by spin-coating, results in the formation of cluster@PVA composite membranes with controlled thicknesses. Remarkably, the effective nonlinear absorption coefficients β for 12-layered membranes are 104 times higher than those of the respective cage solutions. The octahedral cage delivers a stronger response than the tetrahedral cage, which likely reflects ...

{Abstract}: Combining metal complexes with amphiphilic molecules leads to the construction of a wide variety of functional self-assembled nanostructures. Metal complexes exhibiting spin transitions can be good candidates as the trigger to cause structural conversion of such assembly because they respond to various external stimuli. In this work, we studied a structural conversion of supramolecular assembly composed of a [Co2Fe2] complex via a thermally induced electron transfer-coupled spin transition (ETCST). The [Co2Fe2] complex with an amphiphilic anion formed reverse vesicles in solution and showed the thermal ETCST. On the other hand, the thermal ETCST in the presence of a bridging hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) caused structural conversion from the reverse vesicle structure to entangled onedimensional (1D) chains through hydrogen-bond (HB) formations.

{Abstract}: Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) based materials are considered as one of the most promising adsorbents for adsorption-based technology for methane storage. Molecular dynamic simulations are employed to investigate the assembling of single-walled carbon nanotubes into an array via toluene coordinator-molecules. The smallest number of toluene molecules sufficient to maintain the ASWCNT + nC7H8 supramolecular structure is defined. The potential, kinetic and total energies of the simulated system plotted as a function of toluene molecules are used to evaluate the stability condition for the supramolecular structure. Methane adsorption onto the model ASWCNT + nC7H8 adsorbent is simulated to assess the contributions of toluene molecules to its adsorption capacity. The radial and angular probability density distributions of methane molecules in the ASWCNT + nC7H8 adsorbent reveal the most probable location of adsorbed methane near the SWCNT walls and toluene molecules as centers of adsorption. A SWCNT-based ad...

{Abstract}: N-9-Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)- and C-tertiary butyl (t-Bu)-protected glutamate (L-2), bearing a phenanthroline moiety at the side residue, forms 1D supramolecular assemblies via H-bonding as well as undergoing π-stacking interactions to afford crystals or gels that depend on the shape-complementarity of coexisting alcohols, as demonstrated by structural analyses on these assemblies by means of single-crystal X-ray diffractometry and supplemented with small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering data. Moreover, the rheological measurements on the gels help to define a model for when gels and crystals are expected and found. These observations and conclusions highlight an important, but not very appreciated, aspect of solute-solvent interactions within supramolecular assemblies that can allow the constituent-aggregating molecules in some systems to exhibit high selectivity toward the structures of their solvents. The consequences of this selectivity, as demonstrated here by single-crystal and powder X-ray dif...

{Abstract}: Cooperative protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions form programmable complex assemblies, often performing non-linear gene regulatory operations involved in signal transductions and cell fate determination. The apparent structure of those complex assemblies is very similar, but their functional response strongly depends on the topology of the protein-DNA interaction networks. Here, we demonstrate how the coordinated self-assembly creates gene regulatory network motifs that corroborate the existence of a precise functional response at the molecular level using thermodynamic and dynamic analyses. Our theoretical and Monte Carlo simulations show that a complex network of interactions can form a decision-making loop, such as feedback and feed-forward circuits, only by a few molecular mechanisms. We characterize each possible network of interactions by systematic variations of free energy parameters associated with the binding among biomolecules and DNA looping. We also find that the higher-order networks exh...

{Abstract}: Ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) techniques have become highly valued as a tool for structural characterization of biomolecular systems since they yield accurate measurements of the rotationally averaged collision cross-section (CCS) against a buffer gas. Despite its enormous potential, IM-MS data interpretation is often challenging due to the conformational isomerism of metabolites, lipids, proteins, and other biomolecules in the gas phase. Therefore, reliable and fast CCS calculations are needed to help interpret IM-MS data. In this work, we present MassCCS, a parallelized open-source code for computing CCS of molecules ranging from small organic compounds to massive protein assemblies at the trajectory method level of description using atomic and molecular buffer gas particles. The performance of the code is comparable to other available software for small molecules and proteins but is significantly faster for larger macromolecular assemblies. We performed extensive tests regarding accuracy, performa...

{Abstract}: Supramolecularly assembled high-order supercrystals (SCs) help control the dielectric, electronic, and excitonic properties of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) and quantum dots (QDs). Ligand-engineered perovskite NCs (PNCs) assemble into SCs showing shorter excitonic lifetimes than strongly dielectric PNC films showing long photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes and long-range carrier diffusion. Monodentate to bidentate ligand exchange on ≈ 8 nm halide perovskite (APbX3 ; A:Cs/MA, X:Br/I) PNCs generates mechanically stable SCs with close-packed lattices, overlapping electronic wave functions, and higher dielectric constant, providing distinct excitonic properties from single PNCs or PNC films. From Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) images, time-resolved PL, and small-angle X-ray scattering, structurally and excitonically ordered large SCs are identified. An Sc shows a smaller spectral shift (100 meV), a microcrystal (>100 meV), or a bulk crystal (>100 meV). Also, the exciton lifetime (<10 ns) of an SC is exci...

{Abstract}: Precise control of molecular assembly is of great significance in the application of functional molecules. This work has systematically investigated the humidity effect in bubble-assisted molecular assembly. This work finds humidity is critical in the evolution of the soft confined space, leading to the formation of microscale liquid confined space under high humidity, and nanoscale liquid confined space under low humidity. It is also revealed that the differences in surface wettability and adhesion play the key role. Consequently, a flat pattern with thermodynamically favorable ordered structure and a sharp pattern with dynamically favorable disordered structure are achieved, which show different solid-state photoisomerization behaviors and photoresponsiveness. Interestingly, conductivity of sharp pattern with disordered structure is higher than that of flat pattern with layered ordered structure due to electronic transport mechanism of different spatial dimensions. This work opens a new way for manipulating...

{Abstract}: Supramolecular assembly can be used to fabricate complex functional materials by organizing simple building blocks. However, it is difficult to control the hierarchical assembly across multiple length scales. The correlation of a supramolecular gel network and a pre‐gelling aggregate will help to understand how a molecular‐level assembly is translated into a higher order. Here, a functional dipeptide 2NapFF is used that can assemble in different micellar structures at high pH by varying the counterion. Replacing the counterions with a divalent calcium salt results in a cross‐linked gel network, or an interesting analog “gel noodles.” The physical properties of the gel noodles can be varied by choosing specific micellar assemblies as the pre‐gel. The mechanical rigidity of the gel networks is compared by nanoindentation and tensile testing, and the pattern to the structures of the micelles observed by small‐angle X‐ray scattering is correlated. The supramolecular assembly can be fine‐tuned by using different m...

{Abstract}: Abstract The physical, chemical and biological properties of wood depend on the supramolecular assembly of cellulose microfibrils (CMFs), hemicelluloses (HCs) and lignin in the growing cell walls. Based on the 13C-tracer studies of ginkgo xylem formation, a hypothetical scenario for the role of monolignol glucosides (MLGs) in the assembly is proposed as follows: (1) Both moieties, aglycone monolignols and glycone d-glucose (d-Glc), play essential roles in a cooperative manner in delivery of hydrophobic and highly reactive p-hydroxycinnamyl- (H), coniferyl- (G) alcohols to the hydrophilic site of lignin deposition. (2) The d-Glc liberated at lignification site is converted into essential HCs mainly via Golgi apparatus under the influence of diurnally changing turgor pressure, and partly converted in the apoplast. (3) At cell corner middle lamella, a pressure-resistant layer of HG-lignin-HCs-CMFs is formed, and allows expansion of new cells in cambium region by elevation of turgor pressure. The deformable G-lig...

{Abstract}: The conformation and alignment of molecules in organic materials are important because they affect the materials' bulk physical properties. Because two-dimensional (2D) materials offer a simpler model of three-dimensional (3D) materials, the conformation and alignment of molecules in 2D assemblies have been investigated at the atomic scale by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). However, differences in the conformation and alignment of molecules between 2D and 3D assemblies have not been clarified. In this work, the conformation and alignment of a donor-acceptor-type molecule, 4-(3,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-1-yl)benzonitrile (IBN), are studied in 2D and 3D assemblies. Thus, the 2D assembly of IBN on the Au(111) surface was investigated by STM and the 3D assembly of IBN in a single crystal was investigated by X-ray crystallography. Our survey revealed that the conformation of IBN is planar in both 2D and 3D assemblies because of the electron-delocalised structure resulting from the electron-donating and...

{Abstract}: The binding interactions between 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and a series of cucurbit[n]urils (Q[5], Q[6], TMeQ[6], Q[7], Q[8]) have been studied using 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and X-ray crystallography. The data indicates that the Q[5]@4-AP complex exhibits exo binding, which is not observed in the other four host-guest complexes. Furthermore, X-ray crystallography clearly reveals how the Q[n]s bind with 4-AP to form complexes, for example Q[5] forms an outer-surface complex, whilst Q[6], TMeQ[6] and Q[7] formed 1:1 host and guest type complexes, and Q[8] formed a stable 1:2 ternary complex due to its large cavity, which can accommodate two 4-AP molecules.

{Abstract}: Lanthanide upconversion luminescence in nanoparticles has prompted continuous breakthroughs in information storage, temperature sensing, and biomedical applications, among others. Achieving upconversion luminescence at the molecular scale is still a critical challenge in modern chemistry. In this work, we explored the upconversion luminescence of solution dispersions of co‐crystals composed of discrete mononuclear Yb(DBM)3Bpy and Eu(DBM)3Bpy complexes (DBM: dibenzoylmethane, Bpy: 2,2′‐bipyridine). The 613 nm emission of Eu3+ was observed under excitation of Yb3+ at 980 nm. From the series of molecular assemblies studied, the most intense luminescence was obtained for a 1 : 1 molar ratio of Yb3+ : Eu3+, resulting in a high quantum yield of 0.67 % at 2.1 W cm−2. The structure and energy transfer mechanism of the assemblies were fully characterized. This is the first example of an Eu3+‐based upconverting system composed of tw...

{Abstract}: The development of catalytic systems that can activate aryl chlorides for palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions is at the forefront of ongoing efforts to synthesize fine chemicals. In this study, a facile ligand-template approach is adopted to achieve active-site encapsulation by forming supramolecular assemblies; this bestowed the pristine inert counterparts with reactivity, which is further increased upon the construction of a porous framework. Experimental results indicated that the isolation of ligands by the surrounding template units is key to the formation of catalytically active monoligated palladium complexes. Additionally, the construction of porous frameworks using the resulting supramolecular assemblies prevented the decomposition of the Pd complexes into nanoparticles, which drastically increased the catalyst lifetime. These findings, along with the simplicity and generality of the synthesis scheme, suggest that the strategy can be leveraged to achieve unique reactivity and potentially ena...

{Abstract}: Peroxynitrite (ONOO-), a kind of active nitrogen species, plays an important role in biological systems. Overproduction of ONOO- is closely related to the pathogenesis of many diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify intracellular ONOO- for differentiating health and disease states. Fluorescent probes with near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence can detect ONOO- with high sensitivity and selectivity. However, there is an inevitable problem that many NIR fluorophores are easily oxidized by ONOO- to give a false-negative result. To avoid this problem, herein, we ingeniously propose a "destruction to seek to survive" strategy to detect ONOO-. Two NIR squaraine (SQ) dyes were connected together to form a fluorescent probe (SQDC). This method utilizes the destructive effect of peroxynitrite on one of the SQ moieties of SQDC to eliminate the steric hindrance, enabling the other "survived" SQ segment to enter the hydrophobic cavity of bovine serum al...

{Abstract}: 功能分子的组装方向和速率高度可控，使得毛细液桥组装方法在制备多维微结构方面具备独特优势，进而在生产拥有新颖光、电、磁等特性的微纳电子器件方面具备潜在的应用价值.但该方法为了控制功能分子的组装方向，往往依赖于光刻制备且侧面需疏水修饰的模板，从而使该方法步骤繁琐且生产成本较高.为了解决上述问题，本文首先通过数值仿真以及理论分析指出模板的本质作用是通过锚定作用调控液桥表观接触角，从而决定功能分子组装方向.基于上述结论，本文分析了模板曲率调控液桥表观接触角的理论机制，并通过数值仿真以及实验验证了通过柔性模板弯曲变形调控液桥表观接触角的可行性.通过对弯曲方向以及弯曲程度的简便调控，本文成功组装得到结构宽度可调的环形结构.此工作提供了一种简单易行的毛细液桥组装新方法，可以更加高效的调控功能分子组装，为其实现在微纳电子器件方面的应用提供了新的思路.

{Abstract}: The design of soft biomaterials requires a deep understanding of molecular self‐assembly. Here a nanoscale infrared (IR) spectroscopy study of a two‐component supramolecular gel is introduced to assess the system's heterogeneity and supramolecular assembly. In contrast to far‐field IR spectroscopy, near‐field IR spectroscopy revealed differences in the secondary structures of the gelator molecules and non‐covalent interactions at three distinct nano‐locations of the gel network. A β‐sheet arrangement is dominant in single and parallel fibres with a small proportion of an α‐helix present, while the molecular assembly derives from strong hydrogen bonding. However, at the crossing point of two fibres, only the β‐sheet motif is observed, with an intense π–π stacking contribution. Near‐field nanospectroscopy can become a powerful tool for the nanoscale distinction of non‐covalent interactions, while it is expected to advance the existing spectroscopic assessments of supramolecular gels.

{Abstract}: Polymeric carbon nitride (pCN) has attracted increasing interest as a metal-free photocatalyst because of its high efficiency in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. However, due to poor solubility, compounding pCN at the molecular level into more advanced nanocomposites remains a challenge. Herein, we report the dissolution of pCN in polyphosphoric acid (PPA) for the first time and fluid-phase assembly with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into a flexible free-standing membrane. Mechanism and generality studies disclosed that the coordination of the acidity, viscosity, and adsorption energy of the solvents led to the successful dissolution of pCN. Interestingly, the pCN/CNTs molecular composite membrane exhibited not only superior mechanical properties and cycling performance as a result of strengthened π-π interfacial interaction, but also outstanding inactivation of E. coli and S. aureus in sterilization and wound healing for laboratory mice via photogenerated oxygen radicals. It would open a new era of pCN fo...

{Abstract}: Achieving stimulus-responsive performance in room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials especially systems without classic conjugated groups is attractive and important but remains a great challenge. Herein we propose a universal approach to construct colors-tunable RTP supramolecular co-assemblies (AC@amino acid) with excitation wavelength-dependent properties through co-assembly of functional aminoclay (AC) and nonconjugated amino acid using environmentally friendly strategy. Experimental and theoretical results successfully disclose that the RTP feature is attributable to space conjugation through effective space electronic communications among different π and n (lone pair) electrons of amino acid molecules and the effective stabilization of their triplet state by AC. Meanwhile, their colors-tunable performances are mainly owing to the co-existence of clusters with different aggregates degree through recrystallization of amino acid taking AC as a template. Importantly, AC@amino acid exhibit sensitive...

On the other hand, connection of such unique structure and assemblies to unique novel function is still difficult, especially in dynamic molecular assembly. Utilization of molecular motion in the assembly could develop new functional organic material.Herein, we introduce our recent work on unique functional organic materials based on molecular motion in thecondensed phases. Rotation of one-dimensional amide hydrogen-bonding chain of arenealkylamide derivatives inresponse to external electric field afforded ferroelectricity. Collective and anisotropic molecular motion of twisted π molecule induced mechanical force in response to external heating (thermosalience).A variety of molecular motions is possible in organic molecules, which has different mode of motions andactivation energies. With consideration of such factors, materials with new function could be proposed through the ...

{Abstract}: The reaction of cadmium nitrate with anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (HL) and two terpyridine derivatives, 4′-phenyl-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine (L1) and 4′-(4-pyridyl)-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine (L2), led to the formation of two mixed-ligand coordination compounds, [Cd(C21H15N3)(C15H9O2)2] (1) and [Cd2(C20H14N4)2.5(C15H9O2)4]n (2). Coordination compounds were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, FT-IR, UV–Vis and luminescence spectroscopy. X-ray analysis of prepared coordination compounds reveals that 1 is single nuclear coordination complex, whereas 2 is a one-dimension coordination polymer with zigzag chain structure. The nature of L1 and L2 ligands has an essential influence on the molecular geometry and assembly, as well as on the physicochemical properties of complexes 1 and 2. Finally, 1D polymer 2 was utilized as a precursor for the fabrication of an organic light-emitting diode (OLED@2) whose emission wavelengths were investigated at different voltage.

{Abstract}: In this current research work, we fruitfully prepared a mediator-free BiFeO3 hollow spheres/porous g-C3N4 Z-scheme based photocatalysts and utilized it for CO2 conversion and Alizarin Red S degradation. Remarkably, the porous g-C3N4 are prepared by acidic treatment and double calcination method, while BiFeO3 hollow spheres are prepared by employing carbon nanospheres as hard templates. Our results demonstrated that porosity and hollow spheres efficiently upgraded the surface area, light absorption capacity, and photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4 and BiFeO3. Based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), SPS, TEM, FS spectrum associated with the formed •OH amount, and UV-absorbance spectra, it is confirmed that coupling of BiFeO3 hollow spheres with porous g-C3N4 not only thermodynamically provide a suitable platform for receiving the high energy level electrons but also enhanced charge separation. Compared to pristine P–CN, the most optimal sample, 6HBFO/P–CN, showed a 3.5-times enhancemen...

{Abstract}: As one of the most important processes in the process of crystallization, nucleation determines the physicochemical properties of the crystal products. The mechanism of nucleation has not been sufficiently understood due to the complexity of the molecular assembly process. In this work, a rigid molecule of 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (DNBA) was selected as the model compound to investigate the connection between nucleation kinetics and solution chemistry and to investigate the mechanism of nucleation. The nucleation induction period was determined by the nonrandom method, and the parameters including interfacial energy γ and collision frequency f0C0 were calculated.

{Abstract}: To improve the drug loading, tumor targeting, and delivery simplicity of hydrophilic drugs, we propose a supramolecular assembly strategy that potentially benefits a wide range of hydrophilic drug delivery. Firstly, we choose a hydrophilic drug (tirapazamine) as a model drug to directly co-assemble with chlorin e6 (Ce6) at different molar ratios, and systematically evaluate the resultant Ce6-tirapazamine nanoparticles (CT NPs) in aspects of size distribution, polydispersity, morphology, optical properties and molecular dynamics simulation. Based on the assembling facts between Ce6 and tirapazamine, we summarize a plausible rule of the supramolecular assembly for hydrophilic drugs. To validate our findings, more drugs with increasing hydrophilicity, such as temozolomide, gemcitabine hydrochloride and 5-azacytidine, successfully co-assemble with Ce6 into nanostructures by following similar assembling behaviors, demonstrating that our assembling rule may guide a wide range of hydrophilic drug delivery. Next, the...

{Keywords}: (L)-Amino acid * Chiral recognition * Low molecular weight organogelator * Self-assembly
{Abstract}: In this study, we designed and synthesized a low-molecular-weight organogelator derived from (l)-amino acids. We performed gelation assays using (l)-amino acid derivatives to confirm the gelation ability, which was found to be high in several compounds. The (l)-alanine derivatives were determined to be excellent gelators, forming good gels even when smaller amounts were added. These results led to a library of amino acid-derived organogelators. In addition, the thermal properties of the (l)-alanine derivatives with high gelation performance were measured. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the thermal stability of the gels could be controlled by changing the gelator concentration. The surface states of the obtained gels were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements, which confirmed the structure of the self-molecular aggregates. Self-molecular aggregates were observed to be helical or sheet-like, and the gels were constructed by...

{Abstract}: Assembly of molecular systems into extended frameworks guided by weak non-covalent interactions is a hot topic of research in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, by an orchestration of intermolecular interactions guided by halogen bonding, we propose a computational designer strategy to steer the growth of graphyne-like molecular assemblies. Toward this, we analyze the halogen-bonded molecular assemblies of 1,3,5-triazine-based and benzene-1,3,5-tricarbonitrile-based monomers into graphyne-like and graphdiyne-like frameworks. The underlying halogen bonding interactions are quantified by way of intermolecular interaction energies and rationalized by way of molecular electrostatic potential and natural energy decomposition analysis, which allows for the separation of total intermolecular interaction energies into various components. The energetics of complexation indicate that, for the cyano-aromatic-based two-dimensional frameworks, iodo-substituted assemblies are stronger than the corresponding hydrogen-bonded ...

{Abstract}: A macroscopic supramolecular assembly (MSA) refers to non-covalent interactions between building blocks over a micrometer scale, which provides insights into bio-/wet adhesion, self-healing, and so on and new fabrication strategies to heterogeneous structures and bio-scaffolds. The key to realize the MSA of rigid materials is pre-modifying a compliant coating known as a "flexible spacing coating" beneath the interactive moieties. However, available coatings are limited to polyelectrolyte multilayers with shortcomings of tedious fabrication, weak adhesion to substrates, susceptibility to external reagents, and so on. Here, we develop a facile method to induce a new "flexible spacing coating" of a poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) hydrogel with electrostatic interactions to achieve MSA of diverse rigid materials (quartz, metal, rubber, and plastics). Selective self-assembly of positive-negative charged surfaces is observed by the naked eye under 3 min of shaking in water, providing strategies to rapid w...

{Abstract}: Organic crystals hold a significant importance in pharmaceuticals, biological systems and functional materials. In the present study, a tricyclic aromatic structure, tetrahydrocarbazole (THC), incorporating a nitrile functionality was synthesized via the Fischer indolization of 4-hydroxycyclohexanone with 4-hydrazinobenzonitrile hydrochloride in 70% yield. The detailed description of noncovalent interactions of various types and strengths in the crystal structure of tetrahydrocarbazole-carbonitrile was investigated using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. The supramolecular assembly of THC involved the extensive network of NH…O and OH…N hydrogen bonds, and weaker π…π and CH…π contacts. The nature of noncovalent interactions was visualized using molecular electrostatic potential whereas QTAIM and NCIPlot methods revealed the energetic features of π-stacking and H-bonding in the supramolecular assemblies of tetrahydrocarbazole-carbonitrile. In vitro evaluation of urease inhibitory potential ...

{Abstract}: Targeting the use of the second harmonic generation (SHG) as a bioimaging technique to unravel the formation of aggregates, the SHG first hyperpolarizabilities (β) of assemblies of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide derivatives have been evaluated at the density functional theory level. Calculations have revealed that i) the assemblies exhibit SHG responses and the total first hyperpolarizability responses of the aggregates are evolving with their size. The largest aggregation effect is a 18-times increase for βHRS of B4 when going from the monomer to the pentamer, that ii) the intrinsic SHG responses described by the hyper-Rayleigh Scattering  are enhanced in presence of iodine atoms on the phenyl core, that iii) the side chains affect the relative orientation of the dipole moment and first hyperpolarizability vectors, which impacts more the EFISHG quantities than their moduli, and that iv) the radial component to β is dominant for the compounds having the largest responses. These results have been obtained using ...

{Abstract}: The development of multifunctional, stable, and secondarily reactive surface coatings is highly desirable, regardless of the surface structure and chemistry of the textile. However, it has remained a great challenge until now. Commonly used strategies for textile surface functionalization are limited to certain types of fibers or weak and unreliable surface bonds, as well as colored surfaces. Herein, a supramolecular assembly strategy involving phase-transited lysozyme (PTL) and tannic acid (TA) is proposed, which can be used to functionalize various textiles through simple padding and drying. This coating has been shown to withstand 50 washing cycles and 100 rubbing cycles. The PTL/TA coating not only effectively improves the antibacterial properties of textiles (with a 99% bacteriostatic rate), but also enhances UV resistance and antioxidant properties. Additionally, the PTL/TA coating can serve as a secondary reaction platform to prepare X-PTL/TA@fabrics with various functionalities. For instance, sol-gel ...

{Abstract}: Abstract This study aimed to evaluate the shape-memory effect (SME) of wood (Populus x beijingensis W. Y. Hsu) and identify the net-points and switches in its molecular and morphological structures. During several cycles of deformation and subsequent recovery, a high shape recovery rate and ratio were maintained. The transverse compression tests of wet and dry wood reveal that the hydrothermal coupling stimulation can considerably reduce the strength of wood. The X-ray diffraction characterization of wood under hydrothermal stimulation shows that the role of network nodes in the SME of wood is influenced by temperature. The wavenumber shifting and changes in the intensity ratio of the characteristic Fourier transform infrared peaks showed that hydrogen bonds acted as switches for the water-stimulated shape-memory behavior. By taking into account viscoelastic relaxation, a kinetic model derived from nonequilibrium thermodynamic fluctuation theory was used to describe the shape recovery process. The effects of ...

{Abstract}: Single molecule fluorescence microscopy has the unique advantage to provide real-time information on the spatiotemporal assembly of individual protein complexes in cellular membranes. This includes the assembly of proteins into oligomer species of numerous copy numbers. However, there is a need for improved tracing analysis of the real-time growth kinetics of these assemblies in cells with single molecule resolution. Here, we present an automated analysis software to accurately measure the real-time kinetics of assembly of individual high-order oligomer complexes. Our software comes with a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI), is available as a source code and an executable, and can analyze a full data set of several hundred to thousand molecules in less than 2 minutes. Importantly, this software is suitable for the analysis of intracellular protein oligomers, whose stoichiometry is usually more difficult to quantify due to variability in signal detection in the different areas of the cell. We validated our ...

{Abstract}: 探索了多金属氧酸盐(POM)-胆固醇杂化物在自组装过程中的超分子结构与超声时间之间的关系。利用POM与胆固醇之间的协同效应，通过酰胺化反应构建了胆固醇-POM-胆固醇分子结构的杂化物，考察了超声时间对POM-胆固醇杂化物在甲苯中自组装过程的影响。利用TEM和AFM对杂化物自组装形成的超分子结构进行了表征，结果表明，随着超声时间的延长，POM-胆固醇杂化物的组装行为表现出从棒状结构向网络状结构的转变；FT-IR分析结果表明，氢键不是杂化物组装过程中的主要驱动力。在分子水平上解释了超声时间对POM-胆固醇杂化物自组装行为的影响。

{Abstract}: In this paper, three new donor–acceptor complex forms (zBC) containing a helical‐shape dibenzocarbazole analog (DBCz) as the electron donor and 1,2,4,5‐tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) as the electron acceptor via a simple solution‐processing strategy are reported. The beginning components self‐assembled into supramolecular frameworks with glamorous alignment modes and different molar ratios: ≈1:1 P or M‐enantiomer for α‐cocrystal, alternated P/M‐column stacking in mesmeric 2:3 β‐cocrystal, and segregated stacking of γ‐cocrystal. As a result, α‐cocrystal exhibits bright solid‐state red fluorescent, β‐cocrystal shows significant optical waveguide behavior with a low optical loss coefficient of ≈0.018 dB µm−1, and no visual light emission is observed for γ‐cocrystal under ultraviolet radiation. Interestingly, the α‐zBC crystal is not only emissive but also chiroptically active with dissymmetry factor (glum) of 0.004. This study on chiral stacking tailoring paves a way for functional design of orga...

{Abstract}: Regioselective di-functionalization of a cyclodextrin allows hydrophobic domains to be directed in a geometrically controlled manner. This controlled orientation ultimately gives access to an original hierarchical assembly in the solid state. This assembly spans over three levels of hierarchy which are governed by synergistic host-guest inclusions, directed hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding. This combination of interactions precisely positioned in space through regioselective functionalization of a cyclodextrin creates a porous organic architecture.

{Abstract}: γ-Hemolysin (γ-HL) is a hemolytic and leukotoxic bicomponent β-pore-forming toxin (β-PFT), a potent virulence factor from the Staphylococcus aureus Newman strain. In this study, we performed single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) of γ-HL in a lipid environment. We observed clustering and square lattice packing of octameric HlgAB pores on the membrane bilayer and an octahedral superassembly of octameric pore complexes that we resolved at resolution of 3.5 Å. Our atomic model further demonstrated the key residues involved in hydrophobic zipping between the rim domains of adjacent octameric complexes, providing additional structural stability in PFTs post oligomerization. We also observed extra densities at the octahedral and octameric interfaces, providing insights into the plausible lipid-binding residues involved for HlgA and HlgB components. Furthermore, the hitherto elusive N-terminal region of HlgA was also resolved in our cryo-EM map, and an overall mechanism of pore formation for bicomponent β...

{Abstract}: Within of the increasing requirement of alternative approaches to fight emerging infections, nano-photosensitisers (nanoPS) are currently designed with the aim to optimize the antimicrobial photodynamic (aPDT) efficacy. The utilize of less expensive nanocarriers prepared by simple and eco-friendly methodologies and commercial photosensitisers are highly desiderable. In this direction, here we propose a novel nanoassembly composed of water soluble anionic polyester β-CD nanosponges (β-CD-PYRO hereafter named βNS) and the cationic 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4- yl)porphine (TMPyP). Nanoassemblies were prepared in ultrapure water by mixing PS and βNS, by exploiting their mutual electrostatic interaction, and characterized by various spectroscopic techniques such as UV/Vis, Steady-State and Time Resolved Fluorescence, Dynamic Light Scattering and ζ-potential. NanoPS produce appreciable amount of single oxygen similar to free porphyrin and a prolonged stability after 6 days of incubations in physiologic...

{Keywords}: crack resistance;hierarchically lamellar structure;interfacial assembly;self-healing;soft composite
{Abstract}: Soft self-healing materials are compelling candidates for stretchable devices because of their excellent compliance, extensibility, and self-restorability. However, most existing soft self-healing polymers suffer from crack propagation and irreversible fatigue failure due to easy breakage of their dynamic amorphous low-energy polymer networks. Herein, inspired by distinct structure-property relationship of biological tissues, we propose a supramolecular interfacial assembly strategy of preparing soft self-healing composites with unprecedented crack propagation resistance by structurally engineering preferentially-aligned lamellar structures within dynamic and super-stretchable poly(urea-ureathane) matrixes (which can be elongated to 24750× its original length). Such a design affords world-record fracture energy (501.6 kJ m-2 ), ultra-high fatigue threshold (4064.1 J m-2 ), and outstanding elastic restorability (dimensional recovery from 13 times elongation), and preserving low modulus (1...

{Abstract}: To increase the bioavailability of Rhodanine (RH), inclusion complexes (ICs) of RH with both α‐cyclodextrin (α‐CD) and β‐cyclodextrin (β‐CD) were prepared. The complexes were characterized by different physicochemical as well as spectroscopic techniques thereby indicating encapsulation of RH molecule into the cavities of α‐CD and β‐CD cavity. DSC analysis showed that the thermal stability of RH was enhanced after complexation. Computational study suggests the most preferred orientation of RH molecule within both CD cavities. In vitro antibacterial activity test illustrates that the IC2 RH‐α‐CD displayed better activity than pure RH and IC1 RH‐β‐CD. IC2 RH‐α‐CD (IC50=7.88 μM) shows the remarkable in vitro cytotoxic activity than pure RH (IC50=44 μM) and IC1 RH‐β‐CD towards human kidney cancer cell line (ACHN). Furthermore, interaction of RH, IC1 RH‐β‐CD and IC2 RH‐α‐CD with CT‐DNA was investigated and found that α‐CD enhances bioavailability of RH to greater extent compared to β‐CD. Addit...

{Abstract}: Current research work reports the ‘Click’ generation of a ligand, 1- naphtholphthalein linked 1,2,3-triazole (1-NPT) and its “turn-off” absorbance response on binding with Co(II) ions. Copper(I) catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction (CuAAC), a highly stereoselective reaction of ‘Click Chemistry’ is employed to synthesize the five membered heterocyclic ring based probe 1-NPT, that has been successfully characterized by spectroscopic techniques like IR, NMR (1H, 13C) and Mass spectroscopy. The chemosensing behavior of 1-NPT was analyzed by performing UV–Visible titrations with different metal ions like Mn(II), Hg(II), Cd(II), Pb(II), Cu(II), Fe(II), Zn(II), Ba(II), Cr(III), Co(II), K(I) and Na(I) in CH3CN:H2O (4:1, v/v) solution and the results obtained signify the selectivity of synthesized receptor towards Co(II) ions with minimum detection limit of 1.87 µM and 1:1 stoichiometry of 1-NPT:Co(II) complex with no interference of other metal ions.

{Abstract}: Luminescent polymeric gels (LPGs) are promising for wide high-tech applications due to their hydrated state, tunable emission and similarity to bio-tissues. However, most LPGs only exhibit visible luminescence below 630 nm and cannot emit the preferred near-infrared (NIR) luminescence (650 ∼ 900 nm). Herein, we report red-to-NIR aggregation-induced emissive LPGs based on supramolecular co-assemblies of cationic terpyridine platinum(II) luminogen (TPY-Pt) and anionic alginate (Alg) with unexpected large red emission shift (∼100 nm). Combined analyses of UV–Vis/emission spectra, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential results, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that such large red-shifted emission derived from coupling of the dyes’ transition dipole moments in TPY-Pt/Alg co-assemblies. Interestingly, red-to-NIR luminescence was well-preserved after TPY-Pt/Alg co-assemblies were physically incorporated into crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) (PV...

{Abstract}: The supramolecular assembly of symmetrical tetramethylcucurbit[6]uril (TMeQ[6]) and 2-picolylamine (AMPy) has been investigated via various techniques, including ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and X-ray crystallography. The results indicated that TMeQ[6] could encapsulate the AMPy guest molecule to form a stable inclusion complex. The rotational restriction of the guest in the cavity of TMeQ[6] resulted in a large negative value of entropy. The X-ray crystal structure of the 1:1 inclusion complex between TMeQ[6] and AMPy revealed that AMPy exists in the elliptical cavity of TMeQ[6].

{Abstract}: The popular design of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) from the chain relaxation of polymers faces the trade-offs among ion conductivity, stability, and processability. Herein, 2 nm inorganic cryptand molecules with the capability to carry different types of cations, including Ag+, Na+, K+, and Ca2+, are complexed with cationic polymers via ionic interaction, respectively, and the hybrid materials further phase separate into lamellar or hexagonal columnar structures. The successful establishment of ordered structures with ion channels from the packing of inorganic cryptands confers SSEs' excellent ionic conductivity to versatile types of cations. Meanwhile, suggested from the combination of broad dielectric spectroscopy, rheology, and thermal analysis, the fast chain relaxation can activate the dynamics of inorganic cryptand molecules and facilitate the ion hopping process in ion channels. The supramolecular interaction in the complex enables the highly flexible phys...

{Abstract}: Chemotherapy is the main method of treating malignant tumors in clinical treatment. However, the commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs have the disadvantages of high biological toxicity, poor water solubility, low targeting ability, and high side effects. Zwitterionic micelles assembled by amphiphilic dendrimers modified with zwitterionic groups and targeting ligand should largely overcome these shortcomings. Herein, the zwitterionic group and targeting peptide c(RGDfC) were modified on the surface of generation 2 poly(propylene imine) dendrimers (G2 PPI), which was conjugated with hydrophobic N-(2-mercaptoethyl) oleamide to form amphiphilic dendrimers (PPIMYRC). PPIMYRC self-assembled into micelles with doxorubicin (DOX) loaded in the interior of micelles to prepare DOX-loaded micelles (PPIMYRC-DOX micelles).

{Abstract}: Inspired by protein assemblies in biological systems, various artificial protein assemblies have been constructed in these decades. Hemoprotein containing porphyrin iron complex, heme, is a unique building block of the artificial protein assemblies due to the structures, physicochemical properties and functions. In the case of hemoprotein containing b-type heme, the heme cofactor is non-covalently bound to the heme-binding site, heme pocket, in the protein matrix. This review summaries our efforts to utilize heme–heme pocket interactions toward supramolecular hemoprotein assembling systems with various structures and/or functions. Simple monomeric hemoprotein, mainly cytochrome b562, was employed as a useful building block and synthetic heme was attached to the cysteine-introduced variant to form a building block showing self-assembling behavior by interprotein heme–heme pocket interactions. The modulations of linker between synthetic heme and protein surface and/or protein modification site contri...

{Abstract}: Patterning is attractive for nanofabrication, electron devices, and bioengineering. However, achieving the molecular-scale patterns to meet the demands of these fields is challenging. Here, we propose a bubble-template molecular printing concept by introducing the ultrathin liquid film of bubble walls to confine the self-assembly of molecules and achieve ultrahigh-precision assembly up to 12 nanometers corresponding to the critical point toward the Newton black film limit. The disjoining pressure describing the intermolecular interaction could predict the highest precision effectively. The symmetric molecules exhibit better reconfiguration capacity and smaller preaggregates than the asymmetric ones, which are helpful in stabilizing the drainage of foam films and construct high-precision patterns. Our results confirm the robustness of the bubble template to prepare molecular-scale patterns, verify the criticality of molecular symmetry to obtain the ultimate precision, and predict the application potential of h...

{Abstract}: In this work, we study the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) structure in aqueous dispersion with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). In-depth structure analysis is achieved based on a set of complementary and sophisticated algorithms, which provide not only shape and packing of chains but also 3D structure of the colloids. The structure information of the PEDOT chain was extracted from the well-known Guinier, Porod and pair distance distribution function (PDDF) analysis of the SAXS data, while the 3D modelling was achieved with the DAMMIF and DAMAVER programs in ATSAS software package. To the best of our knowledge, we first establish the 3D model of the PEDOT:PSS colloids’ structure that will help people to understand the supramolecular assembly in aqueous dispersion, which sheds light on the solution structure study of polymers that are widely used in daily life.

{Abstract}: Precisely controlled molecular assemblies often display intriguing morphologies and/or functions arising from their structures. The application of the concept of the self-assembly for controlling the aggregation of nanographenes (NGs) is challenging. The title NGs are those carrying both long alkyl chains and tris(phenylisoxazolyl)benzene (TPIB) on the edge. The former group secures the affinity of NGs for organic solvents, and the latter group drives the 1D arrangement of NGs through the interactions between the TPIB units. The concentration-dependent and temperature variable 1 H NMR, UV-vis, and PL spectra demonstrate the aggregation of NGs in 1,2-dichloroethane, and the aggregation is controllable by the regulation of the solvent polarity. AFM images give the stacked structures of the NGs, and these aggregates turn out to be network polymeric structures at a high concentration. These observations demonstrate that the synergy of the face-to-face interactions between the surfaces and the interacti...

{Abstract}: Bacterial cellulose (BC) exhibits beneficial properties for use in biomedical applications but is limited by its lack of tunable transparency capabilities. To overcome this deficiency, a novel method to synthesize transparent BC materials using an alternative carbon source, namely arabitol, was developed. Characterization of the BC pellicles was performed for yield, transparency, surface morphology, and molecular assembly. Transparent BC was produced using mixtures of glucose and arabitol. Zero percent arabitol pellicles exhibited 25% light transmittance, which increased with increasing arabitol concentration through to 75% light transmittance. While transparency increased, overall BC yield was maintained indicating that the altered transparency may be induced on a micro-scale rather than a macro-scale. Significant differences in fiber diameter and the presence of aromatic signatures were observed. Overall, this research outlines methods for producing BC with tunable optical transparency, while also bringing ...

{Abstract}: Exploring supramolecular architectures at surfaces plays an increasingly important role in contemporary science, especially for molecular electronics. A paradigm of research interest in this context is shifting from 2D to 3D that is expanding from monolayer, bilayers, to multilayers. Taking advantage of its high-resolution insight into monolayers and a few layers, scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) turns out a powerful tool for analyzing such thin films on a solid surface. This review summarizes the representative efforts of STM/STS studies of layered supramolecular assemblies and their unique electronic properties, especially at the liquid-solid interface. The superiority of the 3D molecular networks at surfaces is elucidated and an outlook on the challenges that still lie ahead is provided. This review not only highlights the profound progress in 3D supramolecular assemblies but also provides researchers with unusual concepts to design surface supramolecular structures with increasing comp...

{Abstract}: The design of soft biomaterials requires a deep understanding of molecular self-assembly. We introduce here a nanoscale infrared (IR) spectroscopy study of a two-component supramolecular gel to assess the system´s heterogeneity and supramolecular assembly. In contrast to far-field IR spectroscopy, near-field IR spectroscopy revealed differences in the secondary structures of the gelator molecules and non-covalent interactions at three distinct nano-locations of the gel network. A β-sheet arrangement is dominant in single and parallel fibres with a small proportion of an α-helix present, while the molecular assembly derives from strong hydrogen bonding. However, at the crossing point of two fibres, only the β-sheet motif is observed, with an intense π-π stacking contribution. Near-field nanospectroscopy can become a powerful tool for the nanoscale distinction of non-covalent interactions, while is expected to advance the existing spectroscopic assessments of supramolecular gels.

{Abstract}: 早幼粒细胞白血病蛋白(promyelocytic leukemia protein, PML)最早在急性早幼粒细胞白血病(acute promyelocytic leukemia, APL)患者体内被发现。PML本身是一种抑癌蛋白,也是PML核体(PMLnuclearbodies,PMLNBs)的核心组成部分。PMLNBs可以介导转录调控、蛋白修饰、细胞的衰老和凋亡等多种重要的细胞生物学过程。在APL的治疗中,针对PML的靶向治疗已经被证明是一种有效的治疗方式。已有大量的研究表明, PML蛋白和PML核体不仅在APL的发病和治疗中起着重要作用,同时也在多种癌症的发生、发展以及病毒感染中发挥着重要作用。该文回顾了PML领域近年来的研究突破,从PML的形成、相分离、翻译后修饰再到PML在多种癌症和病毒感染中的作用,以此提示PML在癌症靶向、病毒感染的治疗上或许还有更多的应用潜能。

{Abstract}: Cyclodextrins are highly functional compounds with a hydrophobic cavity capable of forming supramolecular inclusion complexes with various classes of molecules including surfactants. The resultant rich nanostructures and their dynamics are an interesting research problem in the area of soft condensed matter and related applications. Herein, we report novel dynamical supramolecular assemblies based on the complexation of β-cyclodextrin with 3 different sulfonic surfactants, which are sodium hexadecylsulfate, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, and myristyl sulfobetaine. It was observed that a β-cyclodextrin : surfactant/2 : 1 molar ratio was ideal for inducing axial growth and imparting large viscosities in the suspensions. Such complexation processes were accompanied by intriguing nanostructural phase behaviors and rheological properties that were very sensitive to the molecular architecture of sulfonic surfactants. The presence of an amino group in the head group of the surfactant allowed for large viscosities t...

{Abstract}: Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer showing rising incidence over the past years. New insights into the mechanisms of melanoma progression contributed to the development of novel treatment options, such as immunotherapies. However, acquiring resistance to treatment poses a big problem to therapy success. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying resistance could improve therapy efficacy. Correlating expression levels in tissue samples of primary melanoma and metastases revealed that secretogranin 2 (SCG2) is highly expressed in advanced melanoma patients with poor overall survival (OS) rates. By conducting transcriptional analysis between SCG2-overexpressing (OE) and control melanoma cells, we detected a downregulation of components of the antigen presenting machinery (APM), which is important for the assembly of the MHC class I complex. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a downregulation of surface MHC class I expression on melanoma cells that showed resistance towards the cytotoxic activity...

{Abstract}: ConspectusIn the field of molecular assembly, photodriven self-assembly is a smart and crucial strategy to regulate the molecular orderliness, multiscale structure, and optoelectronic properties. Traditionally, photodriven self-assembly is based on photochemical processes, through molecular structural change induced by photoreactions. Despite great progress in the photochemical self-assembly, there still exists disadvantages (e.g., the photoconversion rate never reaches 100% with the possible side reactions). Therefore, the photoinduced nanostructure and morphology are often difficult to predict due to insufficient phase transition or defects. In contrast, the physical processes based on photoexcitation are straightforward and can fully utilize photons to avoid the drawbacks of photochemistry. The photoexcitation strategy excludes the change of molecular structure, only utilizing the molecular conformational change from the ground state to excited state. Then, the excited state conformation is employed to dri...

{Abstract}: Two new Cu(II) carboxylate complexes, Cu-NTA and Cu-DNTA, were prepared by treating 2-nitroterephthalic acid with CuSO4·5H2O at room temperature. The synthesized complexes were characterized by elemental (CHN), FT-IR, and thermogravimetric analysis. The crystal structures of both complexes were explored by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, which inferred that the coordination geometry is slightly distorted octahedral and square pyramidal in Cu-NTA and Cu-DNTA, respectively. The non-covalent interactions that are the main feature of the supramolecular assembly were investigated by Hirshfeld surface analysis for both complexes. The propensity of each pair of chemical moieties involved in crystal-packing interactions was determined by the enrichment ratio. Quantum chemical computations were performed to optimize the molecular geometry of complex Cu-NTA and compared it with the experimental single crystal structure, which was found to be in sensible agreement with the experimental s...

{Abstract}: Atomic-thick two-dimensional (2D) graphene oxide (GO) has emerged as an ideal building block in developing ultrathin 2D membranes for separating substances. However, due to the negative charge of GO sheets when hydrated, electrostatic repulsion causes GO membranes to disintegrate easily in water, limiting their wide application in aqueous solutions. Here, we introduce and apply the concept of localized gluing by designing ultra-small supramolecular-assembled nanoparticles as nano-adhesives (NPA) to construct robust GO membranes with a thickness of only 24 nm. The supramolecular-assembled NPA were synthesized by cyclodextrin (CD) and tannic acid (TA) with a uniform size distribution of about 4.5 nm, and exposed surface pyrogallols that could strongly interact with GO sheets. The physical sizing of the NPA confines the interlayer spacing and maintains the nanochannel, while the natural molecular properties of the NPA enhance the connection between adjacent layers and inhibit swelling detachment. The fabricated ...

{Abstract}: Control of self-assembly is significant to the preparation of supramolecular materials, but the control of hydration, responsiveness, dimension, catalysis of macrocyclic amphiphiles in an atom-economic manner is still a great challenge. The herein presented 527 Da low-molecular-weight macrocyclic amphiphile was fabricated by utilizing the selenium-containing crown ether as a hydrophobic motif together with guanidinium group as the hydrophilic moiety. The resulting benzo[21]crown-7 based macrocyclic amphiphile readily forms a redox-responsive solid nanoparticles in water, which can further interconnect into wrinkled pattern on-surface, as well as exhibits as a nanozyme for catalyzing disulfid bond formation. The present work highlights the great potential of guanidinium- and selenium-containing crown ethers for the control of functional assemblies.

{Abstract}: Helical structures are ubiquitous in natural and engineered systems across multiple length scales, while they often exhibit nearly uniform radius and pitch. Utilization of biomimetic structure design to develop stretchable and robust 3D helical structures that are shape-preserving and heat-tolerant is of great interest. Herein, we devise flexible 3D helixes by supramolecular self-assembly and high voltage electric field orientation of molecular chains. The 3D helixes not only inherit buffering mechanics with exceptional shape-retention ability against cyclic stretching but also exhibit excellent heat-resistant quality. The results of the experimental tests confirm that the helix can recover its original shape without obvious residual strain and basically withstand after 2000 cycles under force loading of 10 cN. Such robust biomimetic materials hold great prospects in the fields of artificial muscles, wearable materials, and so on.

{Abstract}: The three-component condensation reaction of 4-methylbenzaldehyde with acetophenone and urea in the presence of CF3COOH was investigated and as a result, 4-phenyl-6-(p-tolyl)pyrimidin-2(1H)-one (PPTP) was synthesized. The structure was determined by single crystal X-rays diffraction analysis which inferred that the PPTP crystallized in monoclinic crystal system with space group P21/c. The dihedral angles between the aromatic rings indicate that the molecule is non-planar. The crystal packing is mainly stabilized by N–H⋯O and C–H⋯O bonding which is further stabilized by off-set π⋯π stacking interactions. The supramolecular assembly is further investigated by Hirshfeld surface analysis. The mechanical behaviour is predicted by the void analysis Moreover, the computational study is carried out for finding the interaction energy between molecular pair by using B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) electron density model. The study inferred the role of various types of interaction energies in stabilizing the crys...

{Abstract}: The development of pyrene-based fluorescent assembled systems with desirable emission characteristics by reducing conventional concentration quenching and/or aggregation-induced quenching （ACQ） is highly desirable. In this investigation, we designed a new azobenzene-functionalized pyrene derivative （AzPy） in which sterically bulky azobenzene is linked to pyrene. Absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic results before and after molecular assembly indicate that even in a dilute N,N-dimethylformamide （DMF） solution （10 μM）, AzPy molecules experienced significant concentration quenching, whereas the emission intensities of AzPy DMF-H2O turbid suspensions containing self-assembled aggregates were slightly enhanced and showed similar values regardless of the concentration. The shape and size of sheet-like structures, from incomplete flakes less than one micrometer in size to well-completed rectangular microstructures, could be adjusted by changing the concentration. Importantly, such sheet-like structur...

{Abstract}: Biomimetic intelligent polymeric hydrogel actuators with cooperative fluorescence‐color switchable behaviors are expected to find great potential applications in soft robotics, visual detection/display, and camouflage applications. However, it remains challenging to realize the spatial manipulation of synergistic shape/color‐changing behaviors. Herein, we report an interfacial supramolecular assembly (ISA) approach that enables the construction of robust fluorescent polymeric hydrogel actuators with spatially anisotropic structures. On the basis of this ISA approach, diverse 2D/3D soft fluorescent hydrogel actuators, including chameleon‐ and octopi‐shaped ones with spatially anisotropic structures, were facilely assembled from two different fluorescent hydrogel building blocks sharing the same physically cross‐linked agar network. Spatially control over synergistic shape/color‐changing behaviors was then realized in one single anisotropic hydrogel actuator. The proposed ISA approach is universal and expected ...

{Abstract}: 多组分组装包含多个可以形成自组装的组分，这在自然过程中是很常见的现象。可以通过分析嵌入天然超分子结构中的结构特点，并根据预测的分子相互作用设计创新材料，但因为对于分子本身性质的理解有限，设计可控层级结构的小分子水凝胶目前仍然面临一定困难，距离自然形成的多层级复杂可控组装体系也比较远。在多组分的超分子化学领域，我们有必要利用系统论的方法研究多组分自组装网络的结构与功能，除了理解组分分子单体的性质，还需要对组分分子形成的化学网络进行研究，才能更好地理解自然。当在多组分系统中触发自组装时，通常产生三种组装方式，即共组装(Co-assembly)、自分类(Self-sorting)和异质多维组装(Multidimensional hierarchical combination of assemblies or heterojunction)。这三种组装体系相互竞争但也可能并存，导致多组分组装体系的复杂性与多元响应性，因此对多组分组装构建块或组装体系的设计与组装结构预测也就具有很大挑战性。多层次的多组分组装过程允许多个自组装体协同和正交运行，并具有精确的空间和时间控制。而自分类现象是多种相关(生物)化学过程(如相分离、动力学解析或自我复制等)的基础，自分类现象可以是自恋的，也可以是社会的，对多组分组装体系中自分类组装进行研究，对于加深理解组分分子相互关系实现对网络的控制，从而实现多层级复杂组装体系的可控构建具有重大意义。本文将就多组分组装体系的特点、研究方法展开综述，并展示多组分组装体系的自分类组装的特点、控制等领域研究成果，讨论小分子凝胶剂在多组分自分类组装水凝胶组装体系的研究进展，以期促进对该领域的理解和深入研究。

{Abstract}: Weak polyelectrolytes （WPEs） are responsive materials used as active charge regulators in a variety of applications, including controlled release and drug delivery in crowded bio-related and synthetic environments. In these environments, high concentrations of solvated molecules, nanostructures, and molecular assemblies are ubiquitous. Here, we investigated the effect of high concentrations of non-adsorbing, short chains of poly（vinyl alcohol）, PVA, and colloids dispersed by the very same polymers on charge regulation （CR） of poly（acrylic acid）, PAA. PVA does not interact with PAA （throughout the full pH range） and thus can be used to examine the role of non-specific （entropic） interactions in polymer-rich environments. Titration experiments of PAA （mainly 100 kDa in dilute solutions, no added salt） were carried out in high concentrations of PVA （13–23 kDa, 5–15 wt%） and dispersions of carbon black （CB） decorated by the same PVA （CB-PVA, 0.2–1 wt%）. The calculated equilibrium constant （and pKa） was up-shifted...

{Abstract}: Despite tremendous efforts, the exact structure of SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses remains elusive. SARS-CoV-2 envelope is a key structural component of the virion that encapsulates viral RNA. It is composed of three structural proteins, spike, membrane (M), and envelope, which interact with each other and with the lipids acquired from the host membranes. Here, we developed and applied an integrative multi-scale computational approach to model the envelope structure of SARS-CoV-2 with near atomistic detail, focusing on studying the dynamic nature and molecular interactions of its most abundant, but largely understudied, M protein. The molecular dynamics simulations allowed us to test the envelope stability under different configurations and revealed that the M dimers agglomerated into large, filament-like, macromolecular assemblies with distinct molecular patterns. These results are in good agreement with current experimental data, demonstrating a generic and versatile approach to model the structure...

{Abstract}: Сo-crystallization of 180°-orienting s-hole-accepting tectons, namely 1,4-diisocyanobenzene (1) and 1,4-diisocyanotetramethylbenzene (2), with such homoditopic halogen bond donors as 1,4-diiodotetrafluorobenzene (1,4-FIB) and 4,4'-diiodoperfluorobiphenyl (4,4'-FIBP) afforded co-crystals 1·1,4-FIB, 1·4,4'-FIBP, and 2·1,4-FIB. Their solid-state structures exhibit 1D-supramolecular arrangements, which are based on poorly explored I···C halogen bonding; this study is the first in which the supramolecular assembly utilizing halogen bonding with a terminal C atom was performed. The use of the potentially tetrafunctional s-hole accepting tetraiodoethylene (TIE) leads to supramolecular architecture of a higher dimension, 3D-framework, observed in the structure of 1·TIE. DFT calculations, used to characterize the halogen bonding situation, revealed that the I···C non-covalent interactions are moderately strong, ranging from  -4.07 in 1·TIE to -5.45 kcal/mol in 2·1,4-FIB. The NBO analysis disclosed that LP(C)→σ* charge...

{Abstract}: The binding interaction between 4-cyanophenol (4-CY) and cucurbit[7]uril has been studied using 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The corresponding absorption and emission spectra obtained in aqueous solution revealed that Q[7] and 4-CY formed a 1:1 host-guest type complex. A single crystal structure was obtained by introducing [ZnCl4]2− and Ca2+ as structural inducers, which revealed that 4-CY was connected to Q[7] or [ZnCl4]2− anion via weak interactions such as hydrogen bonding, C-H···π, ion-dipole, to afford a Q[7]-based supramolecular framework. Interestingly, the framework exhibited a Chinese knot-like structure.

{Abstract}: 分子组装是在分子以上层次创造新物质、产生新功能的重要手段.提升分子组装过程的可控性和组装体功能性是该领域的核心目标,但由于研究复杂分子组装体系的手段和理论的匮乏,迄今绝大部分研究只能限于了解组装过程始末的“黑箱”模式,这成为该领域的发展瓶颈之一.本文围绕分子到亚细胞层次的分子组装体系及其理论方法与模型,尝试将物质、能量与信息作为度量分子组装研究复杂性的三个维度,从简单到复杂地逐级剖析探讨分子组装的理论研究现状、机遇和突破口.首先,在物质维度上揭示分子组装过程呈现多路径、多阶段和多尺度等复杂性;进而在物质基础上引入能量维度,阐明熵驱动或熵焓互补现象普遍存在于分子组装体系中,并探讨远离平衡态的分子组装体系如何产生时空有序的功能耗散结构;继而在物质与能量基础上引入信息维度,探讨分子组装信息网络中的正、负反馈协同,以及如何促使系统涌现出复杂的生理功能.为了突破分子组装理论研究的瓶颈,似乎亟需建立更大的框架.从物质、能量和信息的三个维度协同研究,有望系统深入认知组装规律,进而建立新理论,发展高效精准的调控手段,提升分子组装体系的复杂性和功能性,并可能为生命科学和软物质科学提供新视角和新方法.

{Abstract}: Nature provides diverse models for manufacturing complex and hierarchical materials by controlling molecular assembly at scales ranging from sub-nano to macroscale. However, developing artificial strategies for manufacturing hierarchical materials with comparable machining capabilities to nature is extremely challenging. Here, a templated freezing assembly strategy is reported, enabling simultaneously regulating molecular assembly spatiotemporally to obtain hierarchical materials with structure control from sub-nano to macroscale. In this way, unique centimeter-scale freestanding nanofilms are assembled from diverse molecules, e.g., proteins and conjugated polymers. A generated silk fibroin (SF) nanofilm presents a tunable β-sheet fraction from 5% to 47%, fiber width from 30 to 3,000 nm, and micro-textures with desired shapes. Such a strategy will lay the foundation for customizing hierarchical functional materials from single or multi-component molecules, e.g., desired bio-scaffolds with controlled cell adhe...

{Abstract}: Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing has been proposed to be involved in a bacterial anti-phage defense system called RADAR. RADAR contains an adenosine triphosphatase (RdrA) and an adenosine deaminase (RdrB). Here, we report cryo-EM structures of RdrA, RdrB, and currently identified RdrA-RdrB complexes in the presence or absence of RNA and ATP. RdrB assembles into a dodecameric cage with catalytic pockets facing outward, while RdrA adopts both autoinhibited tetradecameric and activation-competent heptameric rings. Structural and functional data suggest a model in which RNA is loaded through the bottom section of the RdrA ring and translocated along its inner channel, a process likely coupled with ATP-binding status. Intriguingly, up to twelve RdrA rings can dock one RdrB cage with precise alignments between deaminase catalytic pockets and RNA-translocation channels, indicative of enzymatic coupling of RNA translocation and deamination. Our data uncover an interesting mechanism of enzymatic coupling and anti-phag...

{Abstract}: It has been found that CF3COOH catalyzes the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 5-bromo-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and ethyl cyanoacetate. Consequently, the 6-bromo-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carbonitrile (BOCC) compound has been synthesized. The structure was proved by single crystal X-rays diffraction analysis. The asymmetric unit contained two identical molecules A and B which are different with respect to crystallography. The crystal packing is mainly stabilized by C–H⋯N and C–H⋯O bonding which is further stabilized by C–N⋯π and off-set π⋯π stacking interactions. Hirshfeld surface analysis is employed for the further exploration of the intermolecular interactions. Enrichment ratio is computed for the interatomic contacts to find the tendency of the contacts to form the crystal packing interactions. The void analysis is performed to predict the mechanical behaviour. Furthermore, the computational study is performed for finding the interaction energy between molecular pair by using B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) electro...

{Abstract}: New amino derivatives of pillar[5]arene were obtained in three stages with good yields. It was shown that pillar[5]arene containing thiaether and tertiary amino groups formed supramolecular complexes with low molecular weight model DNA. Pillar[5]arene formed complexes with a DNA nucleotide pair at a ratio of 1:2 (macrocycle/DNA base pairs), as demonstrated by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. The association constants of pillar[5]arene with DNA were lgKass1:1 = 2.38 and lgKass1:2 = 5.07, accordingly. By using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, it was established that the interaction of pillar[5]arene containing thiaether and tertiary amino groups (concentration of 10−5 M) with a model nucleic acid led to the formation of stable nanosized macrocycle/DNA associates with an average particle size of 220 nm. It was shown that the obtained compounds did not exhibit a pronounced toxicity toward human adenocarcinoma cells (A549) and bovine lung epithelial cells (LECs). The hypothes...

{Abstract}: Immunogenic cell death (ICD)-induced immunotherapy holds promise for complete elimination and long-term protective immune responses against cancer by combining direct tumor cell killing and antitumor immune response. Some therapeutic approaches (such as hyperthermia, photodynamic therapy, or radiotherapy) and inducers (certain chemotherapy drugs, oncolytic viruses) have been devoted to initiating and/or boosting ICD, leading to the activation of tumor-specific immune responses. Recently, supramolecular assembled bioactive peptide nanodrugs have been employed to improve the efficacy of ICD-induced cancer immunotherapy by increasing tumor targeted accumulation as well as responsive release of ICD inducers, directly inducing high levels of ICD and realizing the simultaneous enhancement of immune response through the immune function of the active peptide itself. Here, the authors review bioactive peptide nanodrugs based on supramolecular assembly, mainly as an intelligent delivery system, a direct ICD inducer and...

{Abstract}: The breakthrough in supramolecular chemistry came in the 1960s when Charles J. Pedersen utilizedthe concept of ‘chemistry beyond molecules’ in the synthesis of the crown ethers. Self-assembly couldallow for the construction of fascinating supramolecular architectures that are otherwise challengingto prepare using covalent chemistry. Supramolecular chemistry has been extensively studied in recentdecades and its applications have been explored to include everything from molecular machines andsensors to gas absorption and nanoreactors to chemical catalysis and drug delivery. In this reviewarticle, some of the commercial applications are discussed to highlight the transition of supramolecularchemistry from theoretical concept to market.

{Abstract}: Multivalency plays a key role in achieving strong, yet reversible interactions in nature, and provides critical chemical organization in biological recognition processes. Chemists have taken an interest in designing multivalent synthetic assemblies to both better understand the underlying principles governing these interactions, and to build chemical tools that either enhance or prevent such recognition events from occurring in biology. Rationally tailoring synthetic strategies to achieve the high level of chemical control and tunability required to mimic these interactions, however, is challenging. Here, we introduce a systematic and modular synthetic approach to the design of well-defined molecular multivalent protein-binding constructs that allows for control over size, morphology, and valency. A series of supramolecular mono-, bi-, and tetrametallic Fe(ii) complexes featuring a precise display of peripheral saccharides was prepared through coordination-driven self-assembly from simple building blocks.

{Abstract}: A novel molecular assembly of a cobalt-sulfate coordination polymer and melamine is synthesized under acidic conditions. Bar-shaped pink monocrystals as long as 1 mm are found to align along magnetic field lines in the proximity of a strong magnet. Magnetometry shows no hysteresis at temperatures down to 2 K but instead magnetic anisotropy and antiferromagnetic coupling. X-ray diffraction on a single crystal reveals that the cobalt-sulfate chains are along the shortest lattice vector or the crystal's long axis. The crystal alignment along the magnetic flux can be attributed to single-ion anisotropy that results in longitudinal antiferromagnetic coupling along the chain. Both structurally and magnetically isotropic crystals of metal-organic hybrid materials can be highly useful as elemental components in magneto-optics.

{Abstract}: Two new Ni(II) and Co(II) coordination compounds, viz., [Ni(H2O)5(DMAP)](IPhth)·2H2O (1) and [Co(Hdmpz)4(H2O)2]Cl2 (2) (where DMAP = 4-dimethylaminopyridine, IPhth = Isophthalate, Hdmpz = 3,5-dimethylpyrazole),were synthesized and characterized using elemental analysis, TGA, spectroscopic (FTIR and electronic) and single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. Compound 1 crystallizes as a co-crystal hydrate of Ni(II), whereas compound 2 is a mononuclear compound of Co(II). The crystal structure analysis of compound 1 reveals the presence of various non-covalent interactions such as anion–π, π–π, C–H∙∙∙π, C–H∙∙∙C, etc., which stabilize the layered assembly of the compound. In compound 2, enclathration of counter chloride ions within the supramolecular trimeric host cavity plays a crucial role in the stabilization of the compound. The non-covalent interactions observed in the crystal structures were further studied theoretically, focusing on the cooperative π-stacking interactions between the DMAP and IPhth count...

Through the connectivity of two pillar[5]arenes by CC double bond, the central tetraphenylethylene (TPE) moiety is simultaneously formed. The resultant bicyclic molecule not only retains the host-guest properties of pillararenes but also introduces the interesting aggregation-induced emission properties inherent in the embedded TPE structure. Three dinitrile derivatives with various linkers are designed as guests (G1, G2, and G3) to form host-guest assemblies with m-TPE Di-EtP5. The morphological control and fluorescence properties of the assemblies are successfully realized. G1 with a shorter alkyl chain as the linker completely threads into the cavities of the host. G2, due to its longer chain length, forms a linear supramolecular polymer upon binding to m-TPE Di-EtP5. G3 differs from G2 by possessing a bulky phenyl group in the middle...

{Abstract}: Plasmonic networks attract increasing attention owing to their strong plasmon coupling effects at hotspot regions, where intriguing, collective optical behavior and field enhancement occur. Engineering network architectures with flexible control over density and intensity of hotspots, thus fine‐tuning electromagnetic field is the prerequisite for fully exploiting their potential use in diverse plasmon‐based applications, but it represents a great challenge. Herein, a cage‐assisted bottom‐up self‐assembly strategy is proposed to construct a series of cage‐bridged complex network architectures with a high degree of flexibility in hotspot modulation. Critical parameters associated with plasmonic networks, including interparticle distance, the density and intensity of hotspots, as well as molecule accessibility of hotspot can be simultaneously and flexibly adjusted at will. Importantly, the integration of host–guest chemistry of molecular cages into interparticle regions of networks endows selective molecule trap...

{Abstract}: Synthetic macrocycles have served as principal tools for supramolecular chemistry, have greatly extended the scope of organic charge transfer (CT) complexes, and have proved to be of great practical value in the solid state during the past few years. In this Minireview, we summarize the research progress on the macrocycle-based crystalline supramolecular assemblies primarily driven by intermolecular CT interactions (a.k.a. macrocycle-based crystalline CT assemblies, MCCAs for short), which are classified by their donor-acceptor (D-A) constituent elements, including simplex macrocyclic hosts, heterogeneous macrocyclic hosts, and host-guest D-A pairs. Particular attention will be focused on their diverse functions and applications, as well as the underlying CT mechanisms from the perspective of crystal engineering. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects are outlined.

{Abstract}: Host-guest assemblies for β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) loaded with 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) or 2-aminobenzothiazole (ABT) were constructed to distinguish their anticorrosive mechanisms for copper in aqueous phase. Their protective efficacies were assessed by weight-loss, electrochemical, surface and solution analyses for copper in the artificial seawater. Achievements proposed that MBT and ABT were stably incorporated in β-CD with distinct thermodynamic traits, which earned the optimal inhibition efficiencies of 95.6 % and 89.2 % at 0.5 g/L dosage following cathodic-dominated mixed-type inhibition mechanism. Coupling theoretical simulations, varied guest release mechanisms and different bonding strengths of Cu-S and Cu-N accounted for the differentiated inhibition behaviors.

{Abstract}: The direct ink writing (DIW) technology is probably the most feasible method for 3D printing hydrogels. The collaborative development of photosensitive hydrogel and DIW printing equipment based on specific application goals is a continuous research hotspot. To avoid UV damage to the skin, the development of an aqueous photoinitiator that can be initiated under visible light is of great significance for 3D printing hydrogel technology. A surfactant with π - π stacking ability is selected, and the water-based photoinitiator (Aqu-PI) is formed by supramolecular assembly with TPO without VOC emission by solvents. The particle size of the Aqu-PI is around 15 nm, and the absorption peak of its UV-visible spectrum reaches the visible region. The photosensitive hydrogel is prepared by Aqu-PI and aqueous monomers including mono functional monomer (AM) and bifunctional monomer (MBA). Then the tackifier is added which makes the viscosity enhance into the photosensitive hydrogel, so hydrogels with better mechanical prope...

{Abstract}: Vaccination shows great promise in cancer immunotherapy. However, the induction of robust and broad therapeutic CD8 T cell immunity against tumors is challenging due to the essential heterogenicity of tumor antigen expression. Recently, bioinspired materials have reshaped the field of cancer nanomedicine. Herein, a bioinspired nanofibrous trivalent peptide hydrogel vaccine was constructed using the spontaneous supramolecular co-assembly of three antigenic epitope-conjugated peptides, which could mimic the fibrillar structure and biological function of the extracellular matrix and naturally occurring protein assembly. The hydrogel vaccine could be accurately and flexibly adjusted to load each antigenic peptide at a defined ratio, which facilitated the antigen presentation of dendritic cells and significantly improved the initiation of CD8 T cell response and the secretion of interferon-γ (IFN-γ). C57BL/6 mice were immunized with the trivalent peptide hydrogel vaccine, where it elicited a high broad-spectrum an...

{Abstract}: Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a superfamily of evolutionarily conserved cyclic nucleotide (cAMP/cGMP)-hydrolyzing enzymes, components of transduction pathways regulating crucial aspects of cell life. Within this family, the cGMP-dependent PDE5 is the major hydrolyzing enzyme in many mammalian tissues, where it regulates a number of cellular and tissular processes. Using Kluyveromyces lactis as a model organism, the murine PDE5A1, A2 and A3 isoforms were successfully expressed and studied, evidencing, for the first time, a distinct role of each isoform in the control, modulation and maintenance of the cellular redox metabolism. Moreover, we demonstrated that the short N-terminal peptide is responsible for the tetrameric assembly of MmPDE5A1 and for the mitochondrial localization of MmPDE5A2. We also analyzed MmPDE5A1, A2 and A3 using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), structural mass spectrometry (MS) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in their native conditions (n...

{Abstract}: Semiconducting membrane combined with nanomaterials is an auspicious combination that may successfully eliminate diverse waste products from water while consuming little energy and reducing pollution. Creating an inexpensive, steady, flexible, and diversified business material for membrane production is a critical challenge in membrane technology development. Because of its unusual structure and high catalytic activity, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has come out as a viable material for membranes. Furthermore, their great durability, high permanency under challenging environments, and long-term use without decrease in flux are significant advantages. The advanced material techniques used to manage the molecular assembly of g-C3N4 for separation membrane were detailed in this review work. The progress in using g-C3N4-based membranes for water treatment has been detailed in this presentation. The review delivers an updated description of g-C3N4 based membranes and their separation functions and new ideas fo...

{Abstract}: The inner and interfacial environments of self-assemblies provide fascinating nano-space for selective and efficient chemical reactions and processes. In biological systems, various chemical reactions, molecular recognition, and transport occur precisely and selectively by virtue of effective molecular interactions on biological membranes and proteins. Considering these advantages and the concept of nanoarchitectonics, we demonstrated that the photochromism of a lophine dimer was accelerated by using confined nano-spaces formed by surfactant micelles. The photoresponsive micelles were used for the rapid controlled release of a model drug upon ultraviolet light irradiation. Furthermore, selective ion recognition inside the self-assembled molecular films at the interfaces was investigated. The anion-π interaction between the anion and an electron-deficient aromatic ring was evaluated on a solid substrate modified with a naphthalenediimide (NDI) analog. Force curve measurements afforded a quantitative analysis o...

{Abstract}: Boronic acids are able to reversibly interact with the diol groups, a commonly found motif in biomolecules including sugars, ribose and catechols. For their carbohydrate-binding properties, they can be regarded as a synthetic mimic of lectins and often termed as "borono-lectins." Importantly, the borono-lectins platform can be chemically tailored to manifest a broad profile of binding strength and specificity. Besides the structural versatility, some derivatives can undergo a sharp inversion in the state of hydration in synchronization with the molecular recognitions. This feature, when combined with amphiphilic polymeric backbones, translates into many creative principles for fine-tuning or switching the hydration and more complex molecular assemblies in a way interactive with biology. Here we provide a brief overview of our recent efforts on the related applications with special focuses on smart insulin delivery systems and sialic acid detections relevant to cancer diagnosis and treatment among others.

{Abstract}: Introduction: In a previous retrospective study using postmortem human brain tissues, we demonstrated that loss of Cholinergic Receptor Muscarinic 1 (CHRM1) in the temporal cortex of a subset of Alzheimer's patients was associated with poor survival, whereas similar loss in the hippocampus showed no such association. Mitochondrial dysfunction underlies Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Therefore, to investigate the mechanistic basis of our findings, we evaluated cortical mitochondrial phenotypes in Chrm1 knockout (Chrm1-/-) mice. Cortical Chrm1 loss resulted in reduced respiration, reduced supramolecular assembly of respiratory protein complexes, and caused mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities. These mouse-based findings mechanistically linked cortical CHRM1 loss with poor survival of Alzheimer's patients. However, evaluation of the effect of Chrm1 loss on mouse hippocampal mitochondrial characteristics is necessary to fully understand our retrospective human tissue-based observations. This is the o...

{Abstract}: 抄録(#br)Synthesizing a possible earliest cell-like molecular assembly from scratch can contribute to investigating the underlying design principle of the current living organisms. Liposomes, closed phospholipid bilayers, are a promising scaffold for this synthetic approach. Therein, the low permeability of the phospholipid membrane prohibits the efficient supply of molecules encapsulated inside, which makes it challenging to assume liposome-based protocells at the origin of life. Using the developed automatic observation platform based on microfluidic devices (termed MANSIONs), we find that liposomes can accumulate some molecules, including analogs of adenosine triphosphate and polyethylene glycol, against their concentration gradient, without proteins but under a hydrodynamic condition. We further elucidate that the negatively charged phospholipids in the liposomal membrane are crucial for this unique molecular transport across the phospholipid membrane (hydrodynamic accumulation; HDA). Finally, we discuss th...

{Abstract}: 抄録(#br)The conformation and alignment of molecules in organic materials play a critical role, influencing the macroscopic properties of these materials. As two-dimensional (2D) materials offer a simplified model of their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts, researchers have extensively investigated the atomic-scale arrangement and alignment of molecules in 2D assemblies using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).[1] This research is focused on the systematic exploration of the structural configuration and alignment of a donor-acceptor-type molecule, specifically 4-(3,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-1-yl)benzonitrile (IBN), within both 2D and 3D assemblies.[2] The study focused on examination of 2D assembly of IBN on the Au(111) via STM and 3D assembly of IBN in a single crystal using X-ray crystallography (Fig. 1).(#br)Our investigation has elucidated that IBN maintains a planar conformation in both 2D and 3D assemblies, and the dipole moment of IBN in the 2D and 3D assemblies are essenti...

{Abstract}: 抄録(#br)Lanthanide elements exhibit unique luminescence and magnetic properties derived from 4f orbital electrons. We have focused on holmium (Ho), which has the highest magnetic moment among lanthanide elements and have been working on preparing liquid crystal materials based on Ho complexes. In this study, we fabricated Ho dinuclear complexes containing two Ho elements in a molecule and created new molecular assemblies with excellent magnetic properties. The Ho dinuclear complexes were found to form hexagonal columnar liquid crystalline phases and showed magnetic field response to a neodymium magnet at room temperature. The mass magnetization measurements confirmed that the complexes are paramagnetic and have magnetic properties derived from Ho.

{Abstract}: Ca2+-mediated molecular assembly of alginate underpins its wide range of applications in foods, pharmaceutics, biomedicines, tissue engineering and environmental treatments. The mode of growth of egg-box structure of alginate in the presence of Ca2+ is a long-standing fundamental problem to be concluded. In this work, we investigate the Ca-induced structural evolution of alginate in dilute solution using atomic force microscopy and dilute solution viscometry. It is demonstrated that the structural evolution follows the three critical steps of monocomplexation, dimerization and multimerization, upon binding with Ca2+. Interestingly, the alginate single chains grow into dimers and multimers via a doubling mode, i.e., successive emerging of dimer, tetramer, octamer, and hexadecamer. Compared with lower guluronate (G) alginate, higher G alginate exhibits a more pronounced multimerization process occurring at a lower ratio of Ca/G. A mechanistic model depicting the evolution of egg...

{Abstract}: Nanostructured heterogeneous photocatalysts process represent attractive strategies to convert directly solar energy to chemical energy, which is important to address the increasing challenges of clean energy and environmental issues. Graphitic carbon nitride, as a metal-free photocatalyst with a suitable bandgap, has played an irreplaceable role in energy and environmental fields. Ultrathin g-C3N4 (UCN) with few layers owns a larger specific area for more reactive sites and intimate interface contact possibility, which provides more function modifications for overcoming inherent drawbacks to realize target-specific applications. In the last few years, developments have been witnessed in the studies of UCN with different synthesis methods or further modifications in photocatalytic energy and environmental application. This review first comprehensively summarized two synthetic approaches of UCN, namely, top-down exfoliation approaches and bottom-up molecular assembly approaches. Then, various modification stra...

{Abstract}: Genome architecture and organization play critical roles in cell life. However, it remains largely unknown how genomic loci are dynamically coordinated to regulate gene expression and determine cell fate at the single cell level. We have developed an inducible system which allows Simultaneous Imaging and Manipulation of genomic loci by Biomolecular Assemblies (SIMBA) in living cells. In SIMBA, the human heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α) is fused to mCherry and FRB, which can be induced to form biomolecular assemblies (BAs) with FKBP-scFv, guided to specific genomic loci by a nuclease-defective Cas9 (dCas9) or a transcriptional factor (TF) carrying tandem repeats of SunTag. The induced BAs can not only enhance the imaging signals at target genomic loci using a single sgRNA, either at repetitive or non-repetitive sequences, but also recruit epigenetic modulators such as histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 to locally repress transcription. As such, SIMBA can be applied to simultaneously visualize and manipulate, i...

{Abstract}: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-induced in situ fluorescent immunosensor is less investigated and reported. Herein, a high-performance ALP-labeled in situ fluorescent immunoassay platform was constructed. The developed platform was based on a fluorogenic self-assembly reaction between pyridineboronic acid (PyB(OH)2) and alizarin red S (ARS). We first used density functional theory (DFT) to theoretically calculate the changes of Gibbs free energy of the used chemicals before and after the combination and simulated the electrostatic potential on its′ surfaces. The free ARS and PyB(OH)2 exist alone, neither emits no fluorescence. However, the ARS/PyB(OH)2 complex emits strong fluorescence, which could be effectively quenched by PPi based on the stronger affinity between PPi and PyB(OH)2 than that of ARS and PyB(OH)2. PyB(OH)2 coordinated with ARS again in the presence of ALP due to the ALP-catalyzed hydrolysis of PPi, and correspondingly, the fluorescence was restored. We chose cTnI and SARS-CoV-2 N protein as the mo...

{Abstract}: Atomic-scale observation by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is essential for characterizing supramolecular assemblies with nonperiodic structures. Identifying the relative spatial arrangement in a mixture of molecular species in an assembly is crucial for understanding chemical reaction systems occurring in the assembly. Herein, we report the first direct observation of supramolecular assemblies comprising anionic clay mineral nanosheets and two types of cationic porphyrin complexes with Pt and Pd atom markers by annular dark-field STEM, enabling the simultaneous imaging of well-mixed spatial molecular distributions. The results expand the possibility of applying electron microscopy to self-assembly structures constructed via weak supramolecular interactions on relatively thick nanosheet materials and on one- to few-atom-thick graphene analogues, which will provide important guidelines for future material design.

{Abstract}: Two new coordination compounds of Mn(II) and Cu(II) involving 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate viz. [Mn3(2,6-PDC)4(H2O)4][Mn(H2O)6]·8H2O (1) and [Cu(2,6-PDC)(H2O)(4-CNpy)]·H2O (2) (2,6-PDC = 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate, 4-CNpy = 4-cyanopyridine) have been synthesized at room temperature. Compound 1 crystallizes as a co-crystal hydrate of Mn(II); whereas compound 2 is a mononuclear compound of Cu(II). Crystal structure analysis of 1 unfolds the presence of Mn(II)(H2O)6 guests within the supramolecular host cavities formed by anionic complex moieties and lattice water molecules. The lattice water molecules of the compounds 1 and 2 are involved in the formation of (H2O)2 cores which are enclathrated in the supramolecular host cavities. Furthermore, the unconventional anion⋯π, antiparallel CN⋯CN, CO⋯CO, CR⋯CR (CR: chelate ring) and Cu⋯O bonding interactions observed in compound 2 play crucial role to the stability of the crystal structure. Theoretical calculations confirm that the H-bonding network in 1 and anion-π, uncon...

{Abstract}: Natural polyphenols (NPPs) are of widespread interest in material engineering; however, only a small fraction of NPPs have been utilized in biomedical applications because of their poor solubility and instability in aqueous conditions. Herein, we report a family of metal-ornamented polyphenol supramolecular (MOPS) assemblies that are highly stable in aqueous solutions for over 6 months. In this one-pot, green synthesis method, metal ions are reduced in water by NPPs to form NPP-capped metal nanoclusters, which then assemble with more NPP molecules to form stable hydrophilic MOPS assemblies. This strategy is generally applicable to a range of NPPs (25 polyphenols tested) regardless of their original water solubility. The resulting stable MOPS assemblies, integrating attributes of both NPPs and metal nanoclusters, possess much stronger antioxidant capabilities than the NPPs, notably a multiplied capacity in superoxide-free radical scavenging capacity. MOPS assemblies can be further engineered, based on polyphen...

{Abstract}: Non-covalent bonds are fundamental for designing self-assembled organic structures with potentially high responsiveness to mechanical, light, and thermal stimuli. The weak intermolecular interaction allows triggering charge-transport, energy-conversion, enzymatic, and catalytic activity, to name a few. Here, we discuss the synergistic action that multiple highly-directional and purely electrostatic bonds have in assembling one molecular specie, namely 4,7-dibromobenzo[c]-1,2,5-thiadiazole (2Br-BTD), in two different patterns on the Au(111) surface. We find, using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT), that multiple secondary-interactions strengthen the electrostatic attraction between the pnicogen and chalcogen atoms forming [S-N]2 heterocycles, the building block of the two networks. Among these interactions, there are halogen-halogen bonds that form characteristic supra-molecular synthons of 3, 4, or 6 molecules. However, not all these nodal structures contribute...

{Abstract}: Bioluminescence imaging has advantages over fluorescence imaging, such as minimal photobleaching and autofluorescence, and greater signal-to-noise ratios in many complex environments. Although significant achievements have been made in luciferase engineering for generating bright and stable reporters, the full capability of luciferases for nanoparticle tracking has not been comprehensively examined. In biocatalysis, enhanced enzyme performance after immobilization on nanoparticles has been reported. Thus, we hypothesized that by assembling luciferases onto a nanoparticle, the resulting complex could lead to substantially improved imaging properties. Using a modular bioconjugation strategy, we attached NanoLuc (NLuc) or Akaluc bioluminescent proteins to a protein nanoparticle platform (E2), yielding nanoparticles NLuc-E2 and Akaluc-E2, both with diameters of ∼45 ​nm. Although no significant differences were observed between different conditions involving Akaluc and Akaluc-E2, free NLuc at pH 5.0 showed signifi...

{Abstract}: Here, a new cyano-bridged 3d–4f compound, a Dy(III)–Fe(III) molecular assembly ([Dy(DMF)4(H2O)3(μ-CN)Fe(CN)5.H2O] (1)), having a structure consisting of neutral one-dimensional (1D) chains, as well as an unbound aqua molecule, was synthesized and characterized using single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared (IR), and elemental analyses. We then examined its structural topologies and studied its density functional theory (DFT), Hirshfeld surface analyses, and photophysical properties. The 1D chains were further linked by H-bond interactions, generating a three-dimensional (3D) motif which stabilizes the whole molecule. The weak interactions in 1 were assessed using Hirshfeld surface analyses, as well as fingerprint plots and DFT studies. Additionally, Hirshfeld surface analysis was performed to elucidate the roles of the weak interactions, such as the H⋯H, C⋯H, C–H⋯π, and van der Waals (vdW) interactions which are pivotal to stabilizing the crystal environment. Furthermore, the DFT studies were used to ...

{Abstract}: The crystal structures of three salts, namely N-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-ium ethoxybenzoate monohydrate (I), N-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-ium methoxybenzoate monohydrate (II) and N-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-ium hydroxybenzoate monohydrate (III), have been determined and compared. In each of them, the ionic components and the water molecules are linked by a combination of N—H···O and O—H···O hydrogen bonds to form infinite chains of edge-fused centrosymmetric rings running parallel to the [100] direction. The C—H···O, C—H···π(arene) interactions and O—H···O in (III) are responsible for the further propagation of the aforementioned chains into di-periodic layers or tri-periodic networks. From an energetic point of view, all structures are primarily di-periodic; the very strong ionic interactions determine the periodicity. For comparison purposes, quantum chemical calculations were performed to show the difference between the ionic and neutral components. The energy of the hydrogen-bonded ring motifs wa...

{Abstract}: The emergence of aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) has attracted substantial scientific attention. However, their antitumor efficacy in photodynamic therapy (PDT) is significantly restricted by the poor water solubility and limited treatment depth. Therefore, a novel AIEgens-involved therapeutic platform with good permeability and bioavailability is urgently required. Herein, supramolecular chemistry is combined with the AIEgen bis-pyrene (BP) to construct a peptide-AIEgen hybrid nanosystem (PAHN). After intravenous injection, the versatile nanoplatform not only improved the hydrophilicity of BP but also achieved stratified targeting from tumor to mitochondrial and induced mitochondrial dysfunction, thus activating caspase-3 upregulation. Then, sonodynamic therapy (SDT), an alternative modality with high tissue penetrability, is performed to evoke reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for BP. More importantly, since the hydrophilic shell is separated from the nanosystem by the specific clea...

{Abstract}: Chemical, physical, biological and materials engineering disciplines use a variety of chiroptical spectroscopies to probe geometrical and optical asymmetry in molecules and particles. Electronic (ECD) and vibrational (VCD) circular dichroism are the most common of these techniques and collectively enable the studies of electronic and vibronic transitions with energies between 0.1 and 5.0 eV. The vibrational states with characteristic energies in the range of 0.001-0.01 eV carry valuable information about concerted intermolecular motions in molecules and crystals involving multiple atoms. These vibronic transitions located in the terahertz (THz) part of the spectrum become increasingly more important for the chemistry, physics, and biology of complex molecules and materials However, the methodology and hardware of THz circular dichroism (TCD) are much less developed than the chiroptical spectroscopies for ultraviolet, visible, near- and mid infrared photons. Here we provide theoretical foundations, practical i...

{Abstract}: Though clarifying the relationship between packing and emission is very important and highly desirable for understanding the mechanism behind responsive luminescent materials, it is not an easy case for piezochromic luminescent materials, due to the difficulties of in situ tracking the interactions change during pressurization. Herein, a smart supramolecular assembly strategy based on two macrocyclic hosts with tailored guests’ packing has been proposed for illustrating the mechanism of piezochromic luminescence. The elusive changes of molecular packing associated with variable luminescence behavior under mechanical forces, such as grinding and high pressure, can be expressed intuitively by cryptand (CP) or cucurbit [7]urils (CB [7])-based host-guest complex in a visualized way. Specifically, the enhanced π-π stacking interactions induced by CP corresponds well to the dim and red-shifted emission under isotropic compression, while the isolated chromophore in non-aromatic CB [7] with reduced intermolecular π-π...

{Abstract}: Developing intelligent supramolecular assemblies endowed with highly tunable optical properties has been a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate pH tolerant metal ion controlled highly tunable optical properties of a fluorescence quenched supramolecular assembly composed of sulfated-β-cyclodextrin (SβCD) templated acridine orange (AO+) aggregates by using an external stimulus, aluminium (Al3+), a well-known neurotoxic metal ion. The addition of Al3+ ion to the AO+-SβCD complex provides a strong screening effect, resisting the electrostatic interaction between the AO+ and SβCD host, which triggers significant changes in the absorption and fluorescence characteristics of the AO+-SβCD complex along with a favorable fluorescence turn-On response. Additionally, the fluorescence On-Off-On switching of AO+ activated by SβCD and Al3+ ion was successfully utilised to construct an uncommon supramolecular-based two-input IMPLICATION logi...

{Abstract}: Noncovalent ionic interactions between nanosized Keplerate-type capsules {Mo132} and tetra-cationic porphyrins have been investigated in aqueous solution using small-angle X-ray scattering, 1H NMR and photophysical methods. These complementary multiscale methods reveal the formation of large hybrid oligomers built from a short-range organization in which the cationic porphyrin is glued onto the large POM surface. The local structuring appears to be strongly dependent on the dye : {Mo132} ratio changing the morphology of the oligomers from linear to dense aggregates.

{Abstract}: A colloidal motor can convert energy stored in the environment to achieve mechanical motion and exhibit dynamic behaviors in fluids. To overcome the challenges presented to a colloidal motor, controlled molecular self-assembly technology provides new opportunities for the precise fabrication of various nanoarchitectures and facilitates fundamental research on rational design, multifunctionalization, propulsion, and controlled movement of colloidal motors. These molecular assembled colloidal motors, also called supramolecular colloidal motors, can perform special tasks at the micro- and nanoscale in the fields of biomedicine, nanotechnology, and environmental remediation. In this feature article, we first introduce the recent progress of controllable self-assembly of spatially asymmetric supramolecular colloidal motors with variable sizes, structures, and functions and discuss the relationship between structure and propulsion. Next, we review the research progress of this type of colloidal motors in biomedical...

{Abstract}: Two new coordination compounds of Zn(II) involving cyanopyridine ligands viz. [Zn(2,6-PDC)(3-CNpy)(H2O)2] (1) and [Zn(4-CNpy)2Cl2] (2) (2,6-PDC = 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate, 3-CNpy = 3-cyanopyridine, 4-CNpy = 4-cyanopyridine) have been synthesized and characterized using elemental analysis, TGA, spectroscopic (FT-IR, electronic and 1H-NMR) techniques and single crystal XRD. Crystal structure analyses of 1 and 2 unfold the presence of unusual π(CN)-π interactions which provide stability to the layered assemblies of the compounds. Anion-π with parallel nitrile–nitrile interactions in 1 and unconventional anion-π(nitrile) with antiparallel nitrile-nitrile interactions in 2 also contribute to the stability of the crystal structures. Antiparallel CO⋯CO interactions give additional reinforcement to the crystal structure of 1. DFT calculations in combination with MEP surface and NCI plot/QTAIM analyses on different self-assembled supramolecular dimers of the compounds revealed that the unusual CN···π inter...

{Abstract}: Phase change materials (PCMs) have demonstrated great potential and vast development prospects in many cutting-edge fields. However, the design and development of smart PCMs with rapid self-healing abilities, and with a reversible switching between rigidity and flexibility, remain challenge. We have here described a strategy that utilizes dynamic carboxylate/zinc ions interactions to achieve this objective. The phase change supramolecular (EAA-Zn-SA) was developed from a commercial, inexpensive and nontoxic ethylene acrylic acid copolymer (EAA) and stearic acid (SA) via crosslinking by zinc ions. It had an excellent leakage-proof, comparable energy storage capacity (130.8 J/g) and could be directly charged by using solar irradiation. As the dynamic carboxylate/zinc ions interactions are temperature sensitive, the designed supramolecular also possessed reversible switching between rigidity and flexibility upon heating or cooling. As a result, the EAA-Zn-SA did not only offer a rapid self-healing behavior, but ...

{Abstract}: Three general effective strategies are shown to mitigate nonradiative losses in the superradiant emission from supramolecular assemblies. J‐aggregates of 5,5′,6,6′‐tetrachloro‐1,1′‐diethyl‐3,3′‐di(4–sulfobutyl)‐benzimidazolocarbocyanine (TDBC) are used to elucidate the nature of nonradiative processes.  Self‐annealing at room temperature (RT), photo‐brightening, and purification of the dye monomers are shown to all lead to substantial increases in emission quantum yields (QYs) and a concomitant lengthening of the emission lifetime, with purification having the largest effect. Structural and optical measurements are used to support a microscopic model that emphasizes the deleterious effects of a small number of impurity and defect sites that serve as nonradiative recombination centers. This understanding has yielded a molecular fluorophore in solution at RT with an unprecedented combination of fast emissive lifetime and high QY. Superradiant emission with a QY of 82% and a lifetime of 174 ps is obtained from J...

{Abstract}: The competitive performance of optoelectronic devices based on advanced organic semiconductors increasingly calls for suitably scalable processing schemes to capitalise on their application potential. With performance benchmarks typically established by spin-coating fabrication, doctor-blade deposition represents a widely available roll-to-roll-compatible means for the preparation of large-area samples and establishing the device upscaling potential. However, the inherently slower film formation kinetics often result in unfavourable active layer microstructures, requiring empirical and material-inefficient optimisation of solutions to reach the performance of spin-coated devices. Here we present a versatile approach to achieving performance parity for spin- and blade-coated devices using in situ gas-assisted drying enabled by a modular 3D-printed attachment. This is illustrated for organic photodetectors (OPDs) featuring bulk heterojunction active layers comprising blends of P3HT and PM6 polymer donors with t...

{Abstract}: Sudan I dye-based smart low molecular weight gelators with/without a perfluoroalkyl group have been successfully synthesized and characterized by rheological measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), IR, and NMR spectroscopies. The gelation behaviors in response to temperature, pH changes, metal cations, and UV-vis light irradiation are investigated. Compounds 1 and 2 could selectively sense the Cu2+ cation in the presence of other metal cations. Moreover, compound 2 with a perfluoroalkyl group shows phase selective gelation ability. This work also provides a valuable reference for exploiting photosensitive materials as chemosensors.

{Abstract}: At nanoconfined interfaces, a micellar ink of lipids was programmed to transform into various secondary structures such as discs, sheets, or sheet and discs via patterning-mediated self-assembly facilitated by polymer pen lithography. Nanoconfinement with printing force, humidity, temperature, pattern size, and total printing time all governed the intramolecular assembly of lipids and determined their structural shape and size. For example, disc or sheet architectures self-organized to produce cochleates or discotic liquid crystals, respectively. In contrast, the combined structure of sheet and discs produced a novel supramolecular output referred to as "nanopalms". The mechanism of nanopalms formation and the origin of their stability were investigated and discussed. Post patterning treatment helped to transform the patterned discs into ribbons and sheets into cochleates that could facilitate the curling of ribbons along their folding direction in a programmed manner via intermolecular self-organization prod...

{Abstract}: ConspectusHyaluronic acid (HA), which contains multiple carboxyl, hydroxyl, and acetylamino groups and is an agent that targets tumors, has drawn great attention in supramolecular diagnosis and treatment research. It can not only assemble directly with macrocyclic host-guest complexes through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions but also can be modified with macrocyclic compounds or functional guest molecules by an amidation reaction and used for further assembly. Macrocycles play a main role in the construction of supramolecular drug carriers, targeted imaging agents, and hydrogels, such as cyclodextrins and cucurbit[n]urils, which can encapsulate photosensitizers, drugs, or other functional guest molecules via host-guest interactions. Therefore, the formed supramolecular assemblies can respond to various stimuli, such as enzymes, light, electricity, and magnetism for controlled drug delivery, enhance the luminescence intensity of the assembly, and improve drug loading capacity. In addition, the n...

{Abstract}: 抄録(#br)To study the possibility of controlling molecular assemblies such as monolayers by using chirality, we synthesized 1-[1-(6-stearyl)pyrenyl]ethanol (SP6E), a novel amphiphilic molecule with a chiral center in the hydrophilic part and a pyrene ring in the long-chain alkyl backbone. The structures of racemic and optically active monolayers of SP6E were characterized using the π–A isotherm and analyzed by Brewster angle microscopy, surface fluorescence spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results showed that (±)-SP6E formed solid solution-like monolayers without any regular structure. By contrast, a one-dimensional columnar structure was observed in the (S)-(−)-SP6E monolayer by AFM, thereby confirming the formation of a relatively controlled monolayer structure. The successful structural control in (S)-(−)-SP6E is considered achieved through the cooperative effects of chirality and π–π stacking of the pyrene ring. Thus, this study demonstrates the possibility of controlling the structure a...

{Abstract}: Solution-processed polycrystalline perovskites (PVKs) have aroused tremendous interest in the optoelectronic device field. However, the inherent high-density defects in the polycrystalline hindered achieving efficient and stable large-area PVK solar cells (PSCs). Although organic molecules are already employed to passivate PVK defects, they are insulating by nature, limiting the carrier transport. Here, we design an assembly of a small molecule (N,N'-di(propanoic acid)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diamide, PDI) via confinement-assisted supramolecular polymerization technology, which is used as a binder for grain boundaries to simultaneously passivate defects and promote carrier transport. The synergistic effect allows the efficiency of all-air processed carbon-based PSCs to reach a decent power conversion efficiency of 14.17%. Importantly, the as-prepared supramolecular assembly completely breaks through the insulating nature of the single molecule, which exists in the long-term defect passivation of PSC...

{Abstract}: Inspired by the hierarchical chiral assembly of porphyrin-proteins in photosynthetic systems, the hierarchical self-assembly of porphyrin-amino acids/peptides provides a novel strategy for constructing functional materials. How to artificially simulate the assembly of porphyrins, proteins, and other cofactors in the photosynthesis system to obtain persistent strong light capture, charge separation and catalytic reactions has become an important concern in the construction of biomimetic photosynthesis systems. This paper summarizes the different assembly strategies adopted in recent years, the effects of driving forces on self-assembly, and the application of porphyrin-peptides in catalysis and biomedicine, and briefly discusses the challenges and prospects for future research.

{Abstract}: The development of human microbiome has collectively correlated the sophisticated interactions between Fusobacterium nucleatum and colorectal cancers (CRCs). However, the treatment of CRC via disruption of gastrointestinal flora remains less explored. Aiming at the up-regulated activity of nitroreductase in F. nucleatum-infected tumors, here, we developed the nitroreductase-instructed supramolecular self-assembly. The designed assembly precursors underwent enzymatic transformation to form assemblies, which agglutinated F. nucleatum and eradicated the targeted bacteria. These assemblies with anti-F. nucleatum activity could further alleviate the bacteria-induced drug resistance effect, thus sensitizing CRC cells against chemo-drugs. Eventually, in mice bearing F. nucleatum-infected CRC, the local introduction of nitroreductase-instructed assemblies could efficiently inhibit the tumor growth. Overall, this study incorporated nitroreductase to broaden the toolbox of enzyme-instructed supramolecular self-assembly...

{Abstract}: Controlled self-assembly has attracted extensive interest in biological and nanotechnological applications. Enzymatic or biocatalytic triggered self-assembly is widely used for the diagnostic and prognostic marker in different pathologies because of their nanostructures and biological effects. However, it remains a great challenge to control the self-assembly of peptides in living cells with a high degree of spatial and temporal precision. Here we demonstrate a light-triggered platform that enables spatiotemporal control of self-assembly from nanoparticles into nanofibers in living cells through subtle molecular conformational changes and internal H-bonding interactions. The platform contained 3-methylene-2-(quinolin-8-yl) isoindolin-1-one, which acts as the light-controlled unit to disrupt the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance through the change of molecular conformation, and a peptide that can be a faster recombinant to assemble via H-bonding interactions. The process has good biocompatibility because it does ...

{Abstract}: Amphiphilic molecules can self-assemble in solution into a variety of supramolecular assemblies, ranging from simple micelles, ribbons, and tubes to complex cubosomes with bicontinuous cubic nanostructures. It is well known that the self-assembly of chiral building blocks into one-dimensional (1D) twisted fibers, helical ribbons, and tubes enables chiral transfer from the molecular scale to super-assemblies. In this study, we investigate the chirality of three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular assemblies, such as colloidal onions, cubosomes, and hexosomes, formed from the same chiral heteroclusters. Unlike supramolecular 1D helical ribbons, these assemblies do not have chiral external shapes or chiral internal nanostructures, but they do exhibit circular dichroism, suggesting that they are chiral. Structural studies revealed that the ordered arrangement of the chiral units in curved superstructures is the origin of the supramolecular chirality of these 3D assemblies. Therefore, this study provides insights for ...

Herein, we report an efficient approach for the construction of macroscopic crystal dendrites with hierarchical chirality based on an in situ solid assembly in a block copolymer film. Chiral fluorescent crystals are formed by enantiopure d-/l-dibenzoyl tartaric acid and pyrenecarboxylic acid in a poly(1,4-butadiene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) film. The chiro-optical activity of the crystalline dendrites can be greatly amplified in the absorption and scattering regions and goes along with the dimension of dendrites. Notably, the chiral dendrites exhibited strong circularly polarized luminescence emission with a high dissymmetric factor (0.03). The enhancement of the quantum yield of the chiral film was up to 28%, which was 14 times higher that of the corresponding fluorescent molecules. The circularly polarized emission bands of the films can be fine-tuned by...

{Abstract}: Understanding the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and proteins is crucial for the successful application of NPs in biological contexts. Protein adsorption is dependent on particle size, and protein binding to ultrasmall (1-3 nm) NPs is considered to be generally weak. However, most studies have involved structured biomacromolecules, while the interactions of ultrasmall NPs with intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) have remained elusive. IDPs are abundant in eukaryotes and found to associate with NPs intracellularly. As a model system, we focused on ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (usGNPs) and tau, a cytosolic IDP associated with Alzheimer's disease. Using site-resolved NMR, steady-state fluorescence, calorimetry, and circular dichroism, we reveal that tau and usGNPs form stable multimolecular assemblies, representing a new type of nano-bio interaction. Specifically, the observed interaction hot spots explain the influence of usGNPs on tau conformational transitions, with implications for the intrac...

{Abstract}: Developing single molecule-assembled nanoprodrugs that can reverse the glutathione (GSH)–mediated drug resistance of tumors provides promising potentials for precision and effective cancer theranostics. Herein, we developed a novel single molecule-assembled nanoprodrug for effective photodynamic/chemotherapeutic eradication of drug-resistant tumors via the multistage GSH-depletion. The nanoprodrug MSSP-NP could be fancily fabricated by self-assembly of an amphiphilic activatable molecular MSSP, which is synthesized by covalently conjugating the photosensitizer methylene blue (MB) with a GSH-sensitive cisplatin prodrug via a tumor targeting thiolated polypeptide. Upon the nanoprodrug MSSP-NP systematic administrated, its photoactivities and pharmacological effects can be thoroughly switched on by intracellular GSH to produce the photosensitizer MB and chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin, along with the multi-step consumption of GSH, which could remarkably boost oxidative stress and reverse the drug resistance.

{Abstract}: Molecular self‐assembly will not become a routine method for building nanomaterials unless our ability to predict the outcome of this process is dramatically improved. Even then, reliable strategies for realizing molecular assemblies with novel functionality are required for building nanomaterials for specific device applications. On the basis of a multifaceted computational approach that integrates several state‐of‐the‐art methods, this paper predicts that bi‐functional on‐surface assemblies of metal phthalocyanine molecules can be realized through the simple strategy of introducing asymmetry into the phthalocyanine ligands. This bi‐functionality arises from a combination of antiferromagnetic ordering within the assembly and presence of locally fluctuating magnetic moments, and has potential applications as non‐Gaussian noise sources in nanodevices.(#br)A computational method for simulating on‐surface molecular self‐assembly is presented. It combines a breadth of advanced techniques (density functional theor...

{Abstract}: Laccases are multicopper oxidases of significant importance for the degradation of phenolic pollutants. Because of the inherent defects of natural laccases in practical applications, herein, we discovered highly effective and non-cytotoxic laccase-like metallo-nanofibers based on the supramolecular assembly of single unnatural amino acid, benzophenone–alanine (BpA), in combination with copper ions. Structural analysis revealed that the catalytic BpA–Cu nanofibers possess a Cu(I)–Cu(II) electron transfer system similar to that in natural laccase. Our BpA–Cu nanofibers exhibit 4 times higher substrate affinity and 24% higher catalytic efficiency than the well-known high-performance industrialized laccase (Novozym 51003) in 2,4-dichlorophenol degradation. In addition, the BpA–Cu nanofibers were demonstrated to be stable (>75% residual activity) in long-term storage at a wide range of pH, ionic strength, temperature, ethanol, and water sample, and to be readily recovered for pollutant degradation, keeping 83% of ...

{Abstract}: Soft colloidal macromolecular structures with programmable chemical functionalities, size, and shape are important building blocks for the fabrication of catalyst systems and adaptive biomaterials for tissue engineering. However, the development of the easy upscalable and template-free synthesis methods to obtain such colloids lack in understanding of molecular interactions that occur in the formation mechanisms of polymer colloids. Herein, a computer simulation-driven experimental synthesis approach based on the supramolecular self-assembly followed by polymerization of tailored pyrazole-modified monomers is developed. Simulations for a series of pyrazole-modified monomers with different numbers of pyrazole groups, different length and polarity of spacers between pyrazole groups and the polymerizable group are first performed. Based on simulations, monomers able to undergo π-π stacking and guide the formation of supramolecular bonds between polymer segments are synthesized and these are used in precipitation...

{Abstract}: The ability to precisely control the subcellular distribution of luminous materials presents unprecedented advantages for understanding cell biology and disease therapy. We introduce a luminescence tool for subcellular distribution imaging and differentiation of live and dead cells, utilizing cationic organoplatinum(II) complexes that exhibit well‐defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration‐dependent switchable luminescence from green to red due to assembly via PtII⋅⋅⋅PtII and π–π stacking interactions. One of the complexes was chosen to demonstrate the unique lysosome‐to‐nucleus subcellular re‐distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells, respectively, which represents the first example to discriminate the subcellular localization of platinum(II) complexes through differential luminescence response. These new findings facilitate the fundamental understanding of self‐assembly behaviors of platinum(II) complexes for potential subcellular detection ...

{Abstract}: The in situ construction of nanomaterials such as intracellular enzyme instructed supramolecular assemblies (EISA) has shown broad biomedical applications. The EISA is a multi-step process in which enzymatic conversion firstly converts precursors into hydrogelators, followed by supramolecular assembly to form nanostructures. In this process, for given hydrogelator with certain assembly propensity, the initial concentration of the corresponding precursor is critical for the formation of intracellular assemblies, which has not been quantitatively assessed due to the lack of proper theoretical model and accurate parameters. Here, based on recent development of a thermodynamic model, we investigate the assembly kinetics of EISA formation within targeted living cells. By establishing a time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy framework, we obtain the fluorescence lifetimes assigned to monomers and assemblies, and decouple the disassembly and assembly kinetics. The obtained (dis)assembly kinetics, combined with...

{Abstract}: The biological skin system of advanced organisms can obtain various environmental stimuli to change skin colors by adjusting the micro-nano structure of the skin surface or by electroluminescence and photoluminescence. The assembly of biominetic skin materials with both changeable structural colors and tunable luminescence is a significant challenge in the fields of advanced materials and light science. This work describes a novel chiral smart bionic skin film with changeable structural colors, tunable luminescence by the polymer-assisted supramolecular assembly of the photonic crystals. A smart nanodot based on the molecule with four-armed mimosa-like structure was assembled on the cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) photonic crystal. The chiral bionic skin film obtained had multi-channel fluorescence-emission, sensitive structural color stimulus responses to the light and humidity and the tunable chiral helical nematic domains. It demonstrates a series of the supramolecular interactions that trigger multiple intel...

{Abstract}: A single pentagon defect in a single‐layered graphene catalyst is emphasized next to a control structure (pentagon ring passivated by oxygen). The small molecules near the defect represent the reactant and intermediate product of the oxygen reduction reaction. Lightning around the graphene indicates how the pentagon defect was fabricated with electro‐assistance and the oxygen reduction reaction was driven by electrical energy. More information on identifying the catalyst's precise active site can be found in the Research Article by F. Qiu, L. Zhang, and co‐workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202700).

{Abstract}: Development of new organic crystals possessing large second‐order optical nonlinearity is very challenging because of strong tendency of centrosymmetric dipole–dipole molecular assembly in crystals. This tendency makes it difficult to develop various analogous crystals that allow fine tuning of optical and physical properties to enhance the device performance. A design approach of an isomorphic crystal library consisting of 11 highly efficient nonlinear optical salt crystals is reported. Analyzing the so‐called isomorphic tolerance space in previously reported mother crystals (PMnXQ chromophores, where PM denotes piperidin‐4‐ylmethanol electron donor, n corresponds to the substituted position of halogen (X) group on the quinolinium (Q) electron acceptor), various substituents are introduced into the PMnXQ crystals at different positions, considering their space‐filling characteristics and interionic interaction ability. All 11 PMnXQ crystals exhibit an isomorphic (or pseudo‐isomorphic) crystal structure, in w...

{Abstract}: The development of implantable bioelectronics is driven by emerging applications including continuous health monitoring and human-machine interfacing. The mechanical mismatch between implanted bioelectronics and tissues not only compromises device accuracy, but also causes interference with tissues undesirably. To address this issue, it is necessary to develop ultrasoft and biocompatible fiber strain sensor with proper stretchability and sensitivity. Here, we fabricate a bacterial cellulose-based sensing fiber which possesses the stretchability and elastic modulus (∼ 102 kPa) close to those of soft tissues. In addition, such fiber has high sensitivity to tiny tensile force/strain (8.8 × 10−3 N/2.5%) and low cell cytotoxicity. These excellent properties make the bacterial cellulose (BC)-based sensing fiber an excellent candidate of implantable bioelectric devices for monitoring subtle motions of organs. We demonstrate this by applying it for continuous monitoring of human pulse and bullfrog heartbea...

{Abstract}: Carboxylic acids are important precursors of chemical raw materials produced from the bioconversion of renewable feedstocks. In these processes, the separation of carboxylic acid products from fermentation broth is of great significance and challenge. In this research, the extraction performance of carboxylic acid using novel hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (DESs) composed of amides and geraniol was studied. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have also been adopted to understand the extraction mechanism. Radial and combined distribution functions analysis shows that hydrogen bond-induced geraniol-carboxylic acid and amide-carboxylic acid multi-molecular assembly drives the separation of carboxylic acids from fermentation broth. Thermodynamics and mean square displacement calculations show that increasing temperature breaks the hydrogen bond networks, and the hydrophobic DESs can be recycled. Finally, a mini-pilot experiment for lactic acid recovery from fermentation broth verified the effectiveness of the...

{Abstract}: Herein, we report a four-step mechanism for the spontaneous multi-scale supramolecular assembly (MSSA) process in a two-phase system concerning an ionic liquid (IL). The complex ions, elementary building blocks (EBBs), [EBB]n clusters and macroscopic assembly (MA) sphere are formed step by step. The porous large-sized [EBB]n clusters in the glassy state can hardly stay in the IL phase and they transfer to the IL-water interface due to both electroneutrality and amphiphilicity. Then, the clusters undergo random collision in the interface driven by the Marangoni effect and capillary force thereafter. Finally, a single MA sphere can be formed owing to supramolecular interactions. To our knowledge, this is the first example realizing spontaneous whole-process supramolecular assembly covering microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic scales in extraction systems. The concept of multi-scale selectivity (MSS) is therefore suggested and its mechanism is revealed. The selective separation and solid...

{Abstract}: Supramolecular cation (SC) structures with high degrees of chemically designed freedoms are one of the most effective building blocks for controlling the dynamic and physical properties of molecular assemblies. Various SC structures, ranging from simple metal ions with different sizes, valences, and magnetic spins to organic ammoniums with diverse molecular structures, can be formed via complexation of crown ether derivatives with different ring sizes, which can be introduced into the π-planar Ni-coordination complexes using electrically conductive and magnetic [Ni(dmit)2] salts (dmit2− = 2-thioxo-1,3-dithiole-4,5-dithiolate). Various dynamics such as ion transport, molecular rotation, and molecular oscillation coexist in a single crystal of [Ni(dmit)2], affecting its electrical conductivity, magnetic behavior, dielectric response, and ferroelectricity. Unlike the physical properties exhibited by a static crystal lattice, the physical properties of a dynamic system depends on external factors such ...

{Abstract}: Many biological molecules are assembled into supramolecular complexes that are necessary to perform functions in the cell. Better understanding and characterization of these molecular assemblies are thus essential to further elucidate molecular mechanisms and key protein-protein interactions that could be targeted to modulate the protein binding affinity or develop new binders. Experimental access to structural information on these supramolecular assemblies is often hampered by the size of these systems that make their recombinant production and characterization rather difficult. Computational methods combining both structural data, molecular modeling techniques, and sequence coevolution information can thus offer a good alternative to gain access to the structural organization of protein complexes and assemblies. Herein, we present some computational methods to predict structural models of the protein partners, to search for interacting regions using coevolution information, and to build molecular assemblies...

{Abstract}: Biomineral materials such as nacre of shells exhibit high mechanical strength and toughness on account of their unique "brick-mortar" multilayer structure. 2-Ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidinone (UPy) derivatives with different types of end groups, due to the self-complementary quadruple hydrogen bonds and abundant Ca2+ binding sites, can easily self-assemble into supramolecular aggregates and act as templates and skeleton in the process of inducing mineral crystallization. In this work, UPy derivatives were used as templates to induce the mineralization and growth of CaCO3 through a CO2 diffusion method. The morphology of CaCO3 crystals was modulated and analyzed by adjusting the synthesizing parameters including Ca2+ concentration, pH, and end groups. The results showed that, by the regulatory role of the mineralization template, it was easier to realize the multilayer crystal structure at a lower concentration of Ca2+ (less than 0.01 mol L-1...

{Abstract}: The instability of hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites presents one of the pressing challenges for their application. This is associated with the sensitivity to moisture as well as mixed ionic-electronic conductivity that leads to enhanced ion migration under conditions of voltage and light bias. Some of the most effective strategies to stabilize hybrid perovskite materials during operation involve the use of interfacial molecular assemblies and low-dimensional perovskite architectures based on hydrophobic organic moieties that could suppress the effects of moisture or ion migration. For this purpose, perfluoroarenes have provided a versatile platform due to their enhanced hydrophobicity as well as the capacity to engage in various noncovalent interactions that affect the characteristics of the resulting assemblies as well as ion migration. This Perspective discusses the emerging role of perfluoroarenes in stabilizing hybrid perovskite materials and their photovoltaic devices through different modes o...

{Abstract}: 抄録(#br)A novel cucurbit[6]uril-based (CB[6]) supramolecular assembly H2NDS·CB[6] (1) (CB[6] = cucurbit[6]uril, H2NDS = 1,6-naphthalenedisulfonic acid) was successfully synthesized using H2NDS as the “structure inducer”. The fluorescence results showed that 1 could be used as a fluorescence sensor for the detection of organic explosives 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), and isoquinoline antibiotics berberine (BER) and palmatine (PAL) in aqueous solution by fluorescence quenching at parts per billion (ppb) levels. Even more exciting, BER exhibits aggregation induced effect (AIE) functionality with 1 in aqueous solution through noncovalent interaction. We have successfully utilized this phenomenon to detect BER, and the limit of detection (LOD) was lower than the fluorescence quenching detection method by 1. This result suggests that we can use the AIE phenomenon of BER to further distinguish 4-NP and TNP from BER. Simultaneously, 1 also displays high adsorptio...

{Abstract}: Per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) contamination has caused worldwide health concerns, and increased demand for effective elimination strategies. Herein, we developed a new indole derivative decorated with a hexadecane chain and a tertiary amine center (named di-indole hexadecyl ammonium, DIHA), which can form stable nanospheres (100–200 nm) in water via supramolecular assembly. As the DIHA nanospheres can induce electrostatic, hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions (all are long-ranged) that operative cooperatively, in addition to the nano-sized particles with large surface area, the DIHA nanocomposite exhibited extremely fast adsorption rates (in seconds), high adsorption capacities (0.764–0.857 g g−1) and selective adsorption for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), outperformed the previous reported high-end PFASs adsorbents. Simultaneously, the DIHA nanospheres can produce hydrated electron (eaq−) when subjected to UV irradiation, with the...

{Abstract}: Nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) is a unique molecular assembly mechanism with high hybridity. Its recombination is conducive to the development of novel lipopeptides. However, there are few reports on NRPS subunit recombination of plipastatin at present. In this paper, plipastatin synthase was modified by the forward movement of subunit PPSE and the replacement of the communication-mediating (COM) domain. The results showed that ppsABE, a new assembly line, could synthesize novel lipopeptides such as cycle pentapeptide (C16-18β-OHFA-E-O-cyclo(Y-T-I), and its antimicrobial activity against Rhizopus stolonifer and Staphylococcus aureus was better than that of plipastatin. However, the reactivity of ppsABCE disappeared, but the substitution of COMDppsC/COMAppsD or COMDppsD/COMAppsE for COMDppsC/COMAppsE could restore its activity and conduct the biosynthesis of linear hexapeptide (C16-17β-OHFA-E-O-Y-T-E-A/V) and heptapeptide (C17-18β-OHFA-E-O...

{Abstract}: The ability to engineer a solvent-exposed surface of self-assembling coiled coils allows one to achieve a higher-order hierarchical assembly such as nano- or microfibers. Currently, these materials are being developed for a range of biomedical applications, including drug delivery systems; however, ways to mechanistically optimize the coiled-coil structure for drug binding are yet to be explored. Our laboratory has previously leveraged the functional properties of the naturally occurring cartilage oligomeric matrix protein coiled coil (C), not only for its favorable motif but also for the presence of a hydrophobic pore to allow for small-molecule binding. This includes the development of Q, a rationally designed pentameric coiled coil derived from C. Here, we present a small library of protein microfibers derived from the parent sequences of C and Q bearing various electrostatic potentials with the aim to investigate the influence of higher-order assembly and encapsulation of candidate small molecule, curcumi...

{Abstract}: 近几年，导电水凝胶应变传感器将不可见的机械刺激转化为可见的电信号的能力越来越受到科研人员的关注.同时，其优异的透明性和导电性也为成为柔性电子产品奠定了基础.然而，由于水凝胶内部存在大量水分，环境适应性差（如低温和长期储存）限制了实际应用.因此，本工作通过使用LiCl作为海藻酸钠分子链超分子组装的触发器并引入甘油作为冷冻保护剂，开发了一种新型离子导电LiCl/PAM/SA-Ca2+水凝胶.结果表明：离子导电水凝胶不仅具有较高的断裂应变（1 920%）和与人体皮肤相似的模量（80 kPa）,而且具有优异的机械强度（375 kPa）、出色的韧性(4.8 MJ·m-3)和高透明度；此外，氯化锂和甘油也赋予其防冻和保湿功能；进一步研究表明：作为柔性应变传感器，离子水凝胶在300%至750%的应变范围内具有高灵敏度（GF=2）和宽检测应变窗口（2.5%～500%）.同时该应变传感器也表现出优异的抗疲劳性（100%应变下200次循环）和低温（-25℃）下的传感灵敏度.这种独特的性能为可穿戴设备在复杂环境中的应用提供了更多可能.

{Abstract}: 本工作报道了含卤键供体和受体片段的三种芳酰胺分子(化合物1～3)的设计和合成,并对固相中卤键的不同作用模式进行了探索和分析.化合物1的晶体数据显示,由于没有分子内氢键,组成分子的三个芳环相互扭转一定角度,并且在分子间交替排列的N…I和O…I卤键的控制下,组装成了一条线型的超分子组装体.由于酰胺羰基和两个紧邻的氟原子之间的排斥作用,化合物2未能形成分子内三中心氢键.在此基础上,将三氟碘代苯作为卤键供体片段引入到化合物3中,并且在折叠体骨架中嵌入了嘧啶单元.化合物3的晶体数据显示,基于多组有效的分子内三中心氢键和分子间较强的卤键作用,双分子间形成了[1+1]的超分子大环.另外,由于嘧啶环的引入,使得该超分子大环接近共平面.

{Abstract}: Applying sunscreen is a common, convenient, and effective measure to protect skin from ultraviolet (UV) damage, but most of UV absorbers in the present commercially available sunscreens are accompanied with the insufficiencies in terms of efficacy and biosafety. The use of nanotechnology to combine conventional UV absorbers with biocompatible natural products is a feasible strategy to combat these deficiencies. Herein, a simple, green and engineering preparation of broad-band sunscreens was demonstrated by the molecular assembly of a UV absorber aminobenzoic acid (ABA) and polyphenol extracted from green tea (EGCG). Spherical and negatively-charged EGCG/ABA nanoparticles (EA NPs) were simply synthesized with a wide range of particle size from 54.6 to 715.1 nm. These NPs had the satisfactory biocompatibility and antioxidative activity, and could protect fibroblasts from oxidative-stress damage. The formulations containing 10 wt% EA NPs further exhibited broad-spectrum UV absorption and lower UV transmittance t...

{Abstract}: 通过设计带手臂链的四面体框架核酸，组装1～3条肽段修饰的手臂链的互补链，以及组装不同种类的脑靶向肽修饰的互补链，比较其毒性、细胞靶向摄取，探讨肽链的数量和种类对四面体DNA纳米探针脑靶向的影响。结果发现，在100 nmol/L浓度范围内，探针无细胞毒性。细胞在不同时间段内对脑靶向Angiopep-2(ANG)肽链修饰的四面体探针的摄取量与单纯四面体比较有显著性差异（P<0.01），在与脑微血管内皮细胞bEnd. 3细胞共孵育0.5 h，与脑胶质瘤细胞U87共孵育1 h，四面体框架核酸组装3条肽链被摄取的量明显比组装1条肽链的摄取量多（P<0.01），但在与细胞共孵育2 h后，组装不同数量肽的探针在细胞内的摄取量没有显著差异。除此外，组装相同数量的噬菌体展示肽TGN和细胞穿膜肽TAT后，组装肽的四面体探针细胞摄取量比单纯四面体细胞内显著升高（P<0.01），但3种肽链组装的四面体探针在bEnd. 3中细胞摄取量并无显著差异。这些结果表明，肽链的数量可能影响短时间内细胞对其摄取的速率，但并不影响2 h后细胞对探针的摄取总量，这一发现可有效节省出四面体修饰位点，为四面体框架核酸的更多功能修饰提供借鉴，在修饰单个靶向肽延长作用时间达到靶向目的的同时，可增加其它位点的功能化修饰，使其结构功能最大化，而且DNA框架核酸还可以作为其它脑靶向肽TGN和TAT的载体。

{Abstract}: Molecular diffusion is a fundamental process underpinning surface-confined molecular self-assembly and synthesis. Substrate topography influences molecular assembly, alignment, and reactions with the relationship between topography and diffusion linked to the thermodynamic evolution of such processes. Here, we observe preferential adsorption sites for tetraphenylporphyrin (2H-TPP) on Au(111) and interpret nucleation and growth of molecular islands at these sites in terms of spatial variation in diffusion barrier driven by local atomic arrangements of the Au(111) surface (the 22× √3 "herringbone" reconstruction). Variable-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy facilitates characterization of molecular diffusion, and Arrhenius analysis allows quantitative characterization of diffusion barriers within fcc and hcp regions of the surface reconstruction (where the in-plane arrangement of the surface atoms is identical but the vertical stacking differs). The higher barrier for diffusion within fcc locations unde...

{Abstract}: In chemistry, function and behaviour flow directly from structure. As chemists seek to develop highly complex functional molecules, we need to harness routes to complex structures. In metallosupramolecular self-assembly, this requires the development of strategies to overcome the tendency of self-assembled systems to be either (1) highly symmetric in the presence of a single ligand type, or (2) statistical equilibrium mixtures in the presence of multiple ligands. This Feature Article describes our efforts to enforce control for the formation of highly ordered and defined architectures that are either low symmetry or comprise lower symmetry components. We have used complementary and orthogonal arrangements of ligands at the metal ion site to control connectivity, with additional conformational or geometric regulation arising through π-π interactions.

{Abstract}: The ability to precisely control the subcellular distribution of luminous materials presents unprecedented advantages for understanding cell biology and disease therapy. We introduce a luminescence tool for subcellular distribution imaging and differentiation of live and dead cells, utilizing cationic organoplatinum(II) complexes that exhibit well-defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration-dependent switchable luminescence from green to red due to assembly via Pt(II)···Pt(II) and π-π stacking interactions. One of the complexes was chosen to demonstrate the unique lysosome-to-nucleus subcellular re-distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells, respectively, which represents the first example to discriminate the subcellular localization of platinum(II) complexes through differential luminescence response. These new findings facilitate the fundamental understanding of self-assembly behaviors of platinum(II) complexes for potential subcellular detection assays.

{Abstract}: Ordered supramolecular assemblies have recently been created using electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged proteins. Despite recent progress, the fundamental mechanisms governing the assembly of oppositely supercharged proteins are not fully understood. Here, we use a combination of experiments and computational modeling to systematically study the supramolecular assembly process for a series of oppositely supercharged green fluorescent protein variants. We show that net charge is a sufficient molecular descriptor to predict the interaction fate of oppositely charged proteins under a given set of solution conditions (e.g., ionic strength), but the assembled supramolecular structures critically depend on surface charge distributions. Interestingly, our results show that a large excess of charge is necessary to nucleate assembly and that charged residues not directly involved in interprotein interactions contribute to a substantial fraction (∼30%) of the interaction energy between oppositely charg...

{Abstract}: A new Cu(II) based coordination polymer (CP) [Cu3(ipa)3(4-clpy)(H2O)2][Cu(ipa)(4-clpy)2(CH3OH)]·3CH3OH (1); (H2ipa = isophthalic acid or benzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid and 4-clpy = 4-chloropyridine) has been synthesized by slow diffusion method in a single pot technique. Single crystal X-ray analysis reveals that compound 1 consists of both one-dimensional (1D) zig-zag chain and two-dimensional (2D) paddle-wheel net, resulting the formation of a three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular architecture via extensive hydrogen bonding, π⋯π stacking and halogen⋯π interactions. The strength of non-covalent interactions in compound 1 has been investigated by Hirshfeld surface analysis. The semiconducting nature of compound 1 was also explored by HOMO-LUMO band-gap calculation using density functional theory (DFT) computation.

Ag2(L1)2(PF6)2 (L1 = 2, 5-bis[1-benzenyl-2-ylidene-imidazolium-3-yl)]-pyridine) (5), Ag2(L2)2(PF6)2 (L2 = 1, 3-bis[1-benzenyl-2-ylidene-benzimidazolium-3-yl)]-benzene) (6), Ag2(L3)2(PF6)2 (L3 = 1, 4-bis[1-(quinolin-8-yl)-2-ylidene-imidazolium-3-yl)]-benzene) (9), and [Ag(L4)PF6]n (L4 = 1, 4-bis[1-benzenyl-1, 2, 4-triazolium-4-yl-5-ylidene)]-benzene) (12), were synthesized from silver oxide and the corresponding NHC ligand precursors (3, 4, 8, and 11). They were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, ESI–MS, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. X-ray crystallography revealed that the Ag-NHC supramolecular assemblies 5, 6, and 9 are a box or square dinuclear Ag-NHC [2+2] metallo-macrocyclic supramolecular assemblies, whereas 12 functioned as a one-dimensional (1D) linear Ag-NHC polymer with the link of carbene CNHC–Ag–CNHC bonds. The structural assignments for 5 were further supported by density functiona...

{Abstract}: A visual drug delivery system (DDS) is urgently needed for precision medicine. DDS-mediated bioorthogonal prodrug activation strategies have demonstrated remarkable advantages in enlarging a therapeutic index via the alleviation of adverse drug reactions. However, the events of bioorthogonal prodrug activation remain inaccessible. Here, we construct a self-reporting bioorthogonal prodrug activation system using fluorescence emission to interpret prodrug activation events. In designed reactive oxygen species (ROS)-instructed supramolecular assemblies, the bioorthogonal reaction handle of tetrazine carries a dual role as fluorescence quencher and prodrug activator. The subsequent inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction simultaneously liberates fluorescence and active drugs, which form a linear relationship. Differentiated by their cellular redox status, ROS-instructed supramolecular assemblies form selectively in both tumor cells and cell spheroids. Upon prodrug treatment, the brightness of fluores...

{Abstract}: Development of peptide-based supramolecular materials with hierarchical morphology and tunable guest loading displays broad potential as drug carrier in view of biocompatibility and biodegradability. Herein, we report a facile Schiff base nanoarchitectonic for supramolecular assembly of diphenylalanine (FF) metastable gel. The addition of trace glutaraldehyde (GA)/H2O solution induces the Schiff base reaction between GA and FF accompanying by phase transition from gel to solution. FF nanoparticles and hierarchical beaded nanofibers with autofluorescence properties can be constructed by regulating the competitive assembly between FF-H2O and FF-GA oligomer. Moreover, various guest molecules with different hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties can be easily loaded into such assembled particles and its release can be triggered under weak alkaline conditions, which show the potential application of the assembled FF system as drug carriers.

{Abstract}: The construction of supramolecular assemblies of heterogeneous materials at the nanoscale is an open challenge in science. Herein, new chiral graphene quantum dots (GQDs) prepared by amidation reaction introducing chiral amide groups and pyrene moieties into the periphery of GQDs are described. The analytical and spectroscopic data show an efficient chemical functionalization and the morphological study of the supramolecular ensembles using SEM and AFM microscopies reveals the presence of highly ordered fibers of several micrometers length. Fluorescence studies, using emission spectroscopy and confocal microscopy, reveal that the fibers stem from the π‐π stacking of both pyrenes and GQDs, together with the hydrogen bonding interactions of the amide groups. Circular dichroism analysis supports the chiral nature of the supramolecular aggregates.(#br)Chiral and fluorescent supramolecular assemblies of graphene quantum dots were built by means of amide hydrogen bonding and π‐π stacking interactions. The structura...

{Abstract}: Our goal in the present study is to investigate the supramolecular assembly of chloroquine (CQ), with the cyclic nature of oligosaccharides, such as 2-(hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin (2HP-β-CD), in an aqueous medium. Using the BH equation, the binding constant (K) and the stoichiometric ratio between the host, 2HP-β-CD, and guest CQ are determined from the spectral changes observed in the absorption and fluorescence spectra. By employing analytical measurements such as FT-IR, SEM, powder XRD, and DSC techniques, inclusion complexes (ICs) are characterized. In addition, DFT analysis using the B3LYP/6-31G method is used to provide the structural proposal for the CQ complex with 2HP-β-CD (CQ:2HP-β-CD-ICs). Likewise, a test with cancer cell lines on the pure CQ and ICs showed no significant difference between the ICs and CQ alone in terms of cytotoxicity performances.(#br)Graphical abstract(#br)[graphic not available: see fulltext]

{Abstract}: Supramolecular packing dictates the physical properties of bio-inspired molecular assemblies in the solid state. Yet, modulating the stacking modes of bio-inspired supramolecular assemblies remains a challenge and the structure-property relationship is still not fully understood, which hampers the rational design of molecular structures to fabricate materials with desired properties. Herein, we present a co-assembly strategy to modulate the supramolecular packing of N-terminally capped alanine-based assemblies (Ac-Ala) by changing the amino acid chirality and mixing with a nonchiral bipyridine derivative (BPA). The co-assembly induced distinct solid-state stacking modes determined by X-ray crystallography, resulting in significantly enhanced electromechanical properties of the assembly architectures. The highest rigidity was observed after the co-assembly of racemic Ac-Ala with a bipyridine coformer (BPA/Ac-DL-Ala), which exhibited a measured Young's modulus of 38.8 GPa. Notably, BPA crystallizes in a centros...

{Abstract}: In addition to native-state structures, biomolecules often form condensed supramolecular assemblies or cellular membraneless organelles that are critical for cell life. These biomolecular assemblies, generally including liquid-like droplets (condensates) and amyloid-like aggregates, can sequester or recruit their interacting partners, so as to either modulate various cellular behaviors or even cause disorders. This review article summarizes recent advances in the sequestration of native factors by biomolecular assemblies and discusses their potential consequences on cellular function, homeostasis, and disease pathology.

It was established that malate anions [Sn(HMal)2(Mal)]3- (1–4) and [Ge(HMal)(Mal)2]4− (5) contain same bidentate HMal2− and Mal3− forms and differ only with their number. The Sn/Ge atoms are six-coordinated and their polyhedrons are distorted octahedrons. The specific feature of the compounds 1–4 is the presence of the additional Cl−anion, that compensates charge of the two [M(phen)3]2+cations and additionally connects them between each other.

{Abstract}: The widespread application of Ag+ has caused increasingly severe environmental pollution, so establishing a practical strategy to simultaneously accomplish the selective detection and efficient removal of heavy metal Ag+ is urgently needed. Herein, a fluorescent supramolecular assembly G⊂H has been precisely constructed through self-assembly of a newly designed pillar [5] arene equipped with two adenine binding sites (H) and a cyano-functionalized tetraphenylethylene derivative (G) bearing aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property. Directed by the mechanism of the restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) and supramolecular assembly-induced emission enhancement (SAIEE), the fluorescence intensity of G⊂H increases dramatically upon the addition of Ag+, generating spherical supramolecular aggregates based on the coordination between adenine moieties and Ag+. Significantly, G⊂H displays outstanding performance for detecting Ag+ with high selectivity, go...

{Abstract}: A novel catalysis-assisted gelation strategy is exploited to assemble a catalogue of covalent gels with superior stability from small molecules via strong covalent bonding. Triazole-based covalent gels with hierarchical porous structure and large surface area are fabricated based on copper(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) polymerization between 1,4-diazidobenzene (A1) and tetrakis(4-ethynylphenyl)methane (B1) /2,2',7,7'-tetraethynyl-9,9'-spirobifuorene (B2) (denoted as triazole-A1B1 and -A1B2 gels). The BET specific surface areas of the triazole aerogels are up to 368 m2 g-1. The triazole gels show superior chemical stability, offer the hierarchical porous structure and rich triazole coordination sites for metal nanoparticles immobilization, and can therefore serve as catalyst supports. A range of metal nanoparticles are readily supported in the gels after wet impregnation and reduction. Among them, Ru nanoparticles are anchored within the gel matrix with small nanoparticl...

{Abstract}: The artificially accurate design of the none-metal electrocatalyst's active site has been a huge challenge since the pure active species with the specific structure could not be strictly controlled by the traditional synthetic methods. The species with the multi configuration in the catalyst hinder the active site identification and the subsequent comprehension of the reaction mechanism. Here, we developed a novel electro-assisted molecular assembly strategy to obtain the pure pentagon ring on the perfect graphene avoiding other reconstructed structures. More importantly, the active atom was confirmed as the topmost sited carbon atom by the subtle passivation process. The reaction mechanism recognition of carbon defect for electrocatalysis is firstly downsized to the single atom scale from the experimental perspective. This innovated electro-assisted molecular assembly strategy is expected to be extensively applied in the active structure-controlled synthesis of none-metal electrocatalysts and the verificatio...

{Abstract}: The reactivity of 2,3-pyridine-dicarboxylic (known as quinolinic or H2qui) acid and 2,5-pyridine-dicarboxylic (known as isocinchomeronic or H2icc) acid has been investigated as a complexing agent toward the niobium(IV) tetrachloride precursor (NbCl4·2THF) in different organic solvent mixtures. It resulted in the isolation of four crystalline assemblies of mononuclear coordination complexes 1-4 [Nb(HL)4·solvent], where HL is the monoprotonated quinolinate (Hqui) ligand (complexes 1-3) or the monoprotonated isocinchomeronate ligand (complex 4). For each complex, the discrete niobium(IV) center is eightfold coordinated to four oxygen atoms from the deprotonated carboxylate arm and four nitrogen atoms from the pyridine part of the dicarboxyl ligand with a dodecahedral environment [NbO4N4]. The remaining carboxyl arm (either in 3 or in 5 position) remained under its protonated form, leading to neutral [Nb(HL)4] moieties for compounds 1, 2...

{Abstract}: The efficient and selective detection of isomers is an attractive but challenging area. In this study, a supramolecular fluorescent probe based on cucurbit[8]uril (Q[8]) and a pyrene-based derivative (G) was prepared, which effectively recognized and removed o-nitrophenol (o-NP) from a mixture of nitrophenol isomers. The newly designed probe G@Q[8] was characterized by NMR spectroscopy, fluorescence emission and UV–Vis spectroscopy, and its host-guest properties in aqueous solution were investigated. The results revealed that the system forms a stable inclusion complex with a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1, which was accompanied by a distinct fluorescence enhancement of G. Moreover, it was employed for the rapid detection of nitrophenol isomers where o-NP showed a dramatical quenching efficiency with a detection limit of 1.53 × 10−7 mol·L-1. This highly efficient supramolecular fluorescent probe offers a new strategy for the convenient detection and removal of o-NP from mixtures in aqueous ...

{Abstract}: This work reports a series of new organic electro‐optic salt crystals possessing unusual orthogonal dipole‐coupling assembly that act as dimple‐free THz generators. In the new crystals, optically anisotropic aromatic anions introducing highly electronegative fluorinated substituents are orthogonally assembled with optically anisotropic nonlinear optical benzothiazolium cations. These orthogonal cation–anion assembled crystals exhibit strong suppression of intrinsic THz phonon modes along the polar axis, which results in a wide THz absorption‐free range from 1.5 to 4.0 THz without substantial absorption peaks. This is sharply in contrast to previous benchmark crystals with parallel cation–anion assembly; for example, in analogous crystals, several strong absorption peaks appear in this frequency range. This absence of strong absorption peaks is attributed to the orthogonal cation–anion dipole coupling assembly, the formation of fluorinate‐induced strong interionic interactions, and a high packing ability of un...

{Abstract}: The construction of supramolecular multivalent assemblies with unique photoluminescence behaviors and biological functions has become a research hot spot recently in the biomaterial field. Herein, we report an adaptive supramolecular assembly via a multivalent co-assembly strategy prepared in two stages by using an adamantane-connected pyrenyl pyridinium derivative (APA2), sulfonated aluminum phthalocyanine (PcS), and folic acid-modified β-cyclodextrin (FA-CD) for efficient dual-organelle targeted photodynamic cancer cell ablation. Benefiting from π-π and electrostatic interactions, APA2 and PcS could first assemble into non-fluorescent irregular nanoaggregates because of the heterodimer aggregation-induced quenching and then secondarily assemble with FA-CD to afford targeted spherical nanoparticles (NPs) with an average diameter of around 50 nm, which could be specifically taken up by HeLa cancer cells through endocytosis in comparison with 293T normal cells. Intriguingly, such multivalent NPs could adaptive...

{Abstract}: Inorganic nanocarriers are potent candidates for delivering conventional anticancer drugs, nucleic acid-based therapeutics, and imaging agents, influencing their blood half-lives, tumor targetability, and bioactivity. In addition to the high surface area-to-volume ratio, they exhibit excellent scalability in synthesis, controllable shape and size, facile surface modification, inertness, stability, and unique optical and magnetic properties. However, only a limited number of inorganic nanocarriers have been so far approved for clinical applications due to burst drug release, poor target specificity, and toxicity. To overcome these barriers, understanding the principles involved in loading therapeutic and imaging molecules into these nanoparticles (NPs) and the strategies employed in enhancing sustainability and targetability of the resultant complexes and ensuring the release of the payloads in extracellular and intracellular compartments of the target site is of paramount importance. Therefore, we will shed l...

{Abstract}: Here we report the use of defects in ordered solvents to form, manipulate, and characterize individual molecular assemblies of either small-molecule amphiphiles or polymers. The approach exploits nanoscopic control of the structure of nematic solvents (achieved by the introduction of topological defects) to trigger the formation of molecular assemblies and the subsequent manipulation of defects using electric fields. We show that molecular assemblies formed in solvent defects slow defect motion in the presence of an electric field and that time-of-flight measurements correlate with assembly size, suggesting methods for the characterization of single assemblies of molecules. Solvent defects are also used to transport single assemblies of molecules between solvent locations that differ in composition, enabling the assembly and disassembly of molecular "nanocontainers". Overall, our results provide new methods for studying molecular self-assembly at the single-assembly level and new principles for integrated nan...

{Abstract}: Molecular resonance can be strengthened by charge transfer, profiting chemical mechanism (CM)-related surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Herein a supramolecular assembly enabled SERS system is established by functionalizing para-sulfonatocalix[4]arene (pSC4) onto Au3Cu nanocrystals (NCs). Due to the cooperation of Au and Cu, pSC4 is directionally assembled on the surface of Au3Cu NCs via van der Waals force, enabling photoinduced and hydrogen bond-induced charge transfer, which remarkably enhances the Raman scattering of methylene blue (MB) captured by pSC4. In particular, for the C-N and C-C stretching of MB, the contributions of resonance Raman scattering increase up to 80%. In addition, the SERS system is able to display affinities of different host-guest interactions, and further employed to evaluate effects of drugs for Alzheimer's disease. In this work, charge transfer is realized by performing supramolecular assembly on the surface of plasmo...

{Abstract}: Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) adaptively regulates synaptic transmission in health and disease. Despite identification of numerous genes that are essential for PHP, we lack a dynamic framework to explain how PHP is initiated, potentiated, and limited to achieve precise control of vesicle fusion. Here, utilizing both mice and Drosophila, we demonstrate that PHP progresses through the assembly and physical expansion of presynaptic signaling foci where activated integrins biochemically converge with trans-synaptic Semaphorin2b/PlexinB signaling. Each component of the identified signaling complexes, including alpha/beta-integrin, Semaphorin2b, PlexinB, talin, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and their biochemical interactions, are essential for PHP. Complex integrity requires the Sema2b ligand and complex expansion includes a ∼2.5-fold expansion of active-zone associated puncta composed of the actin-binding protein talin. Finally, complex pre-expansion is sufficient to accelerate the rate and extent of...

{Abstract}: Dithiolate-amine binary ligand systems based two novel supramolecular structures of Ni(II) coordination compounds [Ni(2-ap)2(i-mnt)] (1) and [Ni2(i-mnt)2(tn)2]n (2) [where i-mnt−2: 1,1-dicyanoethylene-2,2-dithiolate, 2-ap: 2-amino pyridine, tn: 1,3-diaminopropane] have been designed, synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic techniques and X-ray crystallography. In complex 1, the N2S2 coordination kernel around Ni+2 attains distorted square planar geometry (Okuniewski parameter τ/4 = 0.17) and its supramolecular array has a dominant influence of NH···N type hydrogen bonds forming significant ring geometry of graph-set-motifR428. The i-mnt−2 adopts a diverse coordination mode in 2 contrary to 1 resulting in a binuclear one-dimensional infinite polymeric chain structure of consecutive NiS4 [square planar, S4 donor set τ/4 = 0] and NiN6 (octahedral) coordination kernels linked by i-mnt−2 that runs along [1 0 0] axis wherein NH···S, NH··...

{Abstract}: In aqueous media, liquid crystalline droplets typically form spherical shapes in order to minimize surface energy. Recently, non-spherical geometry has been reported using molecular self-assembly of surfactant-stabilized liquid crystalline oligomers, resulting in branched and randomly oriented filamentous networks. In this study, we report a polymerization of liquid crystalline polymeric fibers within a micro-mold. When liquid crystal oligomers are polymerized in freely suspended aqueous media, curvilinear and randomly networked filaments are obtained. When reactive liquid crystalline monomers are oligomerized in a micro-channel, however, highly aligned linear fibers are polymerized. Within a top-down microfabricated mold, a bottom-up molecular assembly was successfully achieved in a controlled manner by micro-confinement, suggesting a unique opportunity for the programming architecture of materials via a hybrid approach.

{Abstract}: The construction of supramolecular assemblies of heterogeneous materials at the nanoscale is an open challenge in science. Herein, new chiral graphene quantum dots (GQDs) prepared by amidation reaction introducing chiral amide groups and pyrene moieties into the periphery of GQDs are described. The analytical and spectroscopic data show an efficient chemical functionalization and the morphological study of the supramolecular ensembles using SEM and AFM microscopies reveals the presence of highly ordered fibers of several micrometers length. Fluorescence studies, using emission spectroscopy and confocal microscopy, reveal that the fibers stem from the π-π stacking of both pyrenes and GQDs, together with the hydrogen bonding interaction of the amide groups. Circular dichroism analysis supports the chiral nature of the supramolecular aggregates.

{Abstract}: A methodology to investigate the linear viscoelastic properties of complex fluids at elevated pressures (up to 120 MPa) is presented. It is based on a dynamic light scattering (DLS) setup coupled with a stainless steel chamber, where the test sample is pressurized by means of an inert gas. The viscoelastic spectra are extracted through passive microrheology. We discuss an application to hydrogen-bonding motif 2,4-bis(2-ethylhexylureido)toluene (EHUT), which self-assembles into supramolecular structures (tubes and filaments) in apolar solvents dodecane and cyclohexane. High levels of pressure (roughly above 20 MPa) are found to slow down the terminal relaxation process; however, the increases in the entanglement plateau modulus and the associated persistence length are not significant. The concentration dependence of the plateau modulus, relaxation times (fast and slow), and correlation length is practically the same for all pressures and exhibits distinct power-law behavior in different regimes. Within the tu...

{Abstract}: How molecular chirality manifests at the nano- to macroscale has been a scientific puzzle since Louis Pasteur discovered biochirality. Chiral molecules assemble into meso-shapes such as twisted and helical ribbons, helicoidal scrolls (cochleates), or möbius strips (closed twisted ribbons). Here we analyze self-assembly for a series of amphiphiles, C n -K, consisting of an ionizable amino acid [lysine (K)] coupled to alkyl tails with n = 12, 14, or 16 carbons. This simple system allows us to probe the effects of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions in chiral assemblies. Small/wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) reveals that at low pH, where the headgroups are ionized (+1), C16-K forms high aspect ratio, planar crystalline bilayers. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that tilted tails of the bilayer leaflets are interdigitated. SAXS shows that, with increasing salt concentration, C16-K molecules assemble into cochleates, whereas at elevated pH (reduced degree...

{Abstract}: An intelligent “antimicrobial switch” has been constructed to reduce prolonged exposure of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics, which could reversibly “turn off” or “turn on” the antimicrobial activity of hemicyanines through self-assembly or dis-assembly of cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]). This assembly effectively inhibited the production of ROS under light, shielding the active site of hemicyanines and achieving on-demand antimicrobial ability. Moreover, CB[7] differentially inhibits ROS of molecules with different alkyl chain lengths, which provided reference for the subsequent design of materials with antimicrobial activity regulation, and could effectively delay or even prevent the development of pathogens resistance.

{Abstract}: Ethyl 4-(4-fluorophenylamino)-2,6-bis(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-3-carboxylate (FTEAA) has been synthesized efficiently in an iodine-catalyzed five-component reaction of 4-fluoroaniline, 4-trifluoromethyl benzaldehyde, and ethyl acetoacetate in methanol at 55 °C for 12 h. Various spectro-analytical techniques such as 1H and 13C NMR and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy have validated the structure of FTEAA. Further confirmation of the structure of FTEAA has been established on the basis of single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The supramolecular assembly of FTEAA in terms of strong and comparatively weak noncovalent interactions is fully investigated by Hirshfeld surface analysis, the interaction energy between pairs of molecules, and energy frameworks. The void analysis is conducted to explore the strength and stability of the crystal structure. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis was computationally performed to see the pote...

{Abstract}: Supramolecular assembly‐induced emission enhancement (SAIEE) systems have been proved to be a highly efficient approach for the fabrication of luminescent nanoparticles with uniform morphology. Herein, fluorescent supramolecular vesicles are constructed from tetraphenylethene‐based cyano‐alkane tetramer (TPE‐(CN)4) and pincer‐like hosts containing two pillar[5]arene units (B‐(TAP[5]A)2) through a synergistic effect of host–guest interactions and hydrophobic interactions. Notably, the emission intensity of supramolecular vesicles can be remarkably enhanced with quantum yield determined to be 37.69%, whereas that of TPE‐(CN)4 is only 18.93% in mixture solvent. Furthermore, the supramolecular vesicles can retard the photocyclization reaction of TPE‐(CN)4 under UV light and exhibit considerable emission intensity at high temperature. Enthused by the above results, artificial light‐harvesting systems with high antenna effect of 18.7 are facilely established by introducin...

{Abstract}: 以烷基胺与二异氰酸酯为原料反应制备双烷基脲稠化剂，无需交联即可通过分子自组装的方式使烷烃稠化，分析反应原料对双烷基脲稠化效果的影响，研究稠化烃基压裂液体系的流变特性和耐温性能。结果表明：2-乙基己胺与2,4-甲苯二异氰酸酯反应得到的2,4-二（乙基己基脲基）甲苯（EHUT）对烷烃的稠化效果最优，随着烷烃碳数、稠化剂浓度的增加而提高；EHUT稠化烃基压裂液的静态流变曲线表现出牛顿体-剪切变稀的特征，动态流变曲线表现出弹性和黏性模量仅有一个交点且在低振荡角频率下基本符合Maxwell型流体的特征，这些流变特性与由蠕虫状胶束形成的黏弹性表面活性剂压裂液体系的流变特性一致，表明体系中小分子在非共价键作用下形成超分子聚集体并相互缠结而呈三维网络结构；由于温度升高会破坏EHUT分子间氢键相互作用，削弱形成超分子聚集体的重要驱动力，因此质量分数为1%的EHUT稠化正庚烷压裂液170 s-1时的表观黏度在60℃降低至20 mPa·s。

{Abstract}: Protein aggregation is a well-recognized problem in industrial preparation, including biotherapeutics. These low-energy states constantly compete with a native-like conformation, which is more pronounced in the case of macromolecules of low stability in the solution. A better understanding of the structure and function of such aggregates is generally required for the more rational development of therapeutic proteins, including single-chain fusion cytotoxins to target specific receptors on cancer cells. Here, we identified and purified such particles as side products of the renaturation process of the single-chain fusion cytotoxin, composed of two diphtheria toxin (DT) domains and interleukin 13 (IL-13), and applied various experimental techniques to comprehensively understand their molecular architecture and function. Importantly, we distinguished soluble purified dimeric and fractionated oligomeric particles from aggregates. The oligomers are polydisperse and multimodal, with a distribution favoring lower an...

{Abstract}: Cyclic nucleotide signalling is a key component of antiviral defence in all domains of life. Viral detection activates a nucleotide cyclase to generate a second messenger, resulting in activation of effector proteins. This is exemplified by the metazoan cGAS-STING innate immunity pathway1, which originated in bacteria2. These defence systems require a sensor domain to bind the cyclic nucleotide and are often coupled with an effector domain that, when activated, causes cell death by destroying essential biomolecules3. One example is the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which degrades the essential cofactor NAD+ when activated in response to infection in plants and bacteria2,4,5 or during programmed nerve cell death6. Here we show that a bacterial antiviral defence system generates a cyclic tri-adenylate that binds to a TIR-SAVED effector, acting as the 'glue' to allow assembly of an extended superhelical solenoid structure. Adjacent TIR...

{Abstract}: Self-assembling polymers by bioinspired directional supramolecular interactions currently hold great scientific and technological interests. Herein, we report an unorthodox strategy based on a dipole-dipole interaction-mediated extended antiparallel dipolar assembly of a model merocyanine (MC) dye for maneuvering the self-assembly of a highly water-soluble MC-functionalized block copolymer (P2). Unlike traditional amphiphilic block copolymers featuring distinct hydrophobic segments (flexible aliphatic hydrocarbon chains or rigid nonpolar aromatic scaffolds), P2 comprises polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (PEG) as a hydrophilic block and an unconventional structure-directing acrylate block functionalized with polar MC-dyes in the side chains of every repeat unit. In the absence of any additional hydrophobic assistance, P2 spontaneously self-assembles in water through the continuous opposite alignment of its pendant MCs by multiple dipole-dipole interactions to cancel out their ground state dipole moments, w...

{Abstract}: This work deals with the development of ultra-thin film nanosensors for selective and sensitive detection of toxic Hg2+ cations in aqueous media. 1,8-Bis[(2-aminoethyl)amino]anthraquinone D0 was functionalized by alkoxy groups of different length to prepare ligands D3 and D12 with linear arrangement of two polyamine receptors and two lipophilic alkyl chains. Chemosensor D0 only binds copper(II) and mercury(II) cations in water/methanol (1:1 v/v) solutions with no interference by other metal cations. The introduction of alkoxy groups to the anthraquinone scaffold, which are required to form Langmuir monolayers and ultra-thin films on solid supports, does not change the sensing properties of the anthraquinone D0. In contrast to systems without specific molecular order (i.e. solutions and drop-cast films), Langmuir monolayers and ultra-thin Langmuir-Blodgett films of alkoxy-substituted ligands selectively bind only mercury(II) cations, even in the presence of copper(II) ions and 10 other interfering c...

{Abstract}: We present a general molecular framework assembly algorithm that takes a largely arbitrary molecular fragment database and a user-supplied target template graph as input. Automatic assembly of molecular fragments from the database, following a prescribed, user-supplied set of connection rules, then turns the template graph into an actual, chemically reasonable molecular framework. Assembly capabilities of our algorithm are tested by producing several abstract, closed-loop shapes. To indicate a few of many possible application areas we demonstrate a host-guest complex and a road toward catalysis. Postassembly substituent exchange can be used to produce electric fields of desired values at desired points inside the framework or at its surface as a stepping stone toward rationally designed, artificial heterogeneous catalysts.

{Abstract}: Switchable Photoluminescent Small Molecular NIR‐II Dyes(#br)In article number 2202414 by Dipanjan Pan and co‐workers, three small molecular NIR‐II dyes are synthesized that show augmentation in emission intensity (Switch‐On) when self‐assembled in presence of cucurbit[8]uril (structures shown in cover picture). The results show that further addition of carbon dots to the nanocubes leads to the quenching of fluorescence of these host‐guest complexes (Switch‐Off). The described strategy thus provides flexibility in the user‐defined tuning of photoluminescence.

{Abstract}: Photo-responsive supramolecular systems offer intriguing functional aspects which have led to their applications in diverse fields such as optoelectronics and biomedicine. However, the modulation of the luminescence output in a spatiotemporal fashion by photo-controlled transformation still remains a challenging task. Herein, we report the controlled regulation of the emission color of supramolecular assemblies of amphiphilic cyanostilbenes (CSs) in water through in situ photomodulation employing UV and sunlight. Due to their aggregation-induced emission (AIE) features, the CS chromophores in the supramolecular assemblies exhibited bright greenish-yellow emission. Photoirradiation predominantly led to the formation of a cyclized product exhibiting aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) features and having efficient cyan-blue emission in water but severely quenched emission in the solid state. Hence, starting from a unicomponent scaffold, photomodulation provided tunable emission ranging from greenish-yellow to cy...

{Abstract}: ConspectusFacing increasing demand for precision medicine, materials chemistry systems for bioanalysis with accurate molecular design, controllable structure, and adjustable biological activity are required. As a genetic biomacromolecule, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is created via precise, efficient, and mild processes in life systems and can in turn precisely regulate life activities. From the perspective of materials chemistry, DNA possesses the characteristics of sequence programmability and can be endowed with customized functions by the rational design of sequences. In recent years, DNA has been considered to be a potential biomaterial for analysis and has been applied in the fields of bioseparation, biosensing, and detection imaging. To further improve the precision of bioanalysis, the supramolecular assembly of DNA on micro/nanointerfaces is an effective strategy to concentrate functional DNA modules, and thus the functions of DNA molecules for bioanalysis can be enriched and enhanced. Moreover, the ne...

{Abstract}: Due to the continued miniaturization of semiconductor devices, slurry formulations utilized in the chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process have become increasingly complex to meet stringent manufacturing specifications. Traditionally, in shallow trench isolation (STI), CMP, a contact cleaning method involving a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) brush, is used to effectively transfer cleaning chemistry to the oxide substrate. This PVA brush can cause nonuniform cleaning chemistry transport, increased interfacial shear force, and cleaning-induced defectivity from brush loading. Previous work with traditional cleaning processes has shown that using "soft" supramolecular cleaning chemistries has dramatically improved cleaning efficacy while also minimizing the number of induced p-CMP defects. To minimize these effects, noncontact cleaning via the implementation of megasonic action has gained attention. This work employs "soft" cleaning chemistries with Cu2+-amino acid complexes, which can catalyze the ...

{Abstract}: The assembly of an inclusion complex in an aqueous medium using a metabolizer drug (dyphylline) as guest and β-cyclodextrin as host has been established, which is extremely appropriate for a variety of applications in modern biomedical sciences. The formation of the inclusion complex is established by 1H NMR, and surface tension and conductivity measurements demonstrate that the inclusion complex was produced with 1:1 stoichiometry. The thermodynamic parameters based on density, viscosity, and refractive index measurements were used to determine the nature of the complex. This research also forecasts how dyphylline will release in the presence of CT-DNA without any chemical modifications. The produced insertion complex (IC) has a higher photostability due to the drug dyphylline being protected by β-CD. The antibacterial activity of dyphylline greatly improved after complexation and exhibited higher toxicity against Gram-negative (highest against Escherichia coli) in comparison to Gram-positive bact...

{Abstract}: The cytoplasmic domain of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) plays roles as a kinase and a protein scaffold; however, the allocation of these two functions is not fully understood. Here, we analyzed the assembly of the transmembrane (TM)-juxtamembrane (JM) region of EGFR, one of the best studied members of RTKs, by combining single-pair fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging and a nanodisc technique. The JM domain of EGFR contains a threonine residue (T654) that is phosphorylated after ligand association. We observed that the TM-JM peptides of EGFR form anionic lipid-induced dimers and cholesterol-induced oligomers. The two forms involve distinct molecular interactions, with a bias toward oligomer formation upon threonine phosphorylation. We further analyzed the functions and oligomerization of whole EGFR molecules, with or without a substitution of T654 to alanine, in living cells. The results suggested an autoregulatory mechanism in which T654 phosphorylation causes a switch of the major functi...

{Abstract}: The 2-Aryl 3-Hydroxybenzo[g]quinolones (2Ar3HBQ) are a relatively new family of ESIPT fluorophores distinguished by their visible absorption spectra, which makes them potential ratiometric probes for biological media. In the present work, we found that 2Ar3HBQ residing as guest fluorophores inside biomimetic host systems like surfactant supramolecular assemblies like micelles and reverse micelles, exhibit dual emission attributable to ESIPT. Ratiometric analysis of the two emission peaks corresponding to the normal (N*) and tautomer (T*) species indicated that the ESIPT rates depend strongly on the nature of the host supramolecular assembly. For example, the ESIPT rate in reverse micelles containing no water was found to be similar to that in weak H-bonding and low polar solvents like acetonitrile. However, addition of water leads to the formation of water nano-droplets inside the reverse micelles, with concomitant sharp decrease of ESIPT rates. In each of the cases studied, the major factor determining the E...

{Abstract}: It is very appealing to synthesize functional soft materials from natural and abundant plant diterpenes because they have conformationally rigid and chiral properties. Herein, dehydroabietic-based monoamide (DA-1) and diamide (DA-2) were designed by introducing device interactions, π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding, with an aromatic group, C═O, and N-H. DA-1 and DA-2 can be gelled in a mixed solvent and a single solvent, respectively. Several novel supramolecular organic gels including highly entangled three-dimensional networks composed of rods or fibers were constructed. Interestingly, DA-2 forms a helical structure that is right-handed under the cooperative control of the solvent and the rigid structure of rosin. Gel formation was primarily driven by hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and van der Waals force. Combined with Gaussian calculation and X-ray diffraction (XRD), we established pack patterns for each system, revealing the roles played by rosin and amide groups. Moreover, the carbon tetrachloride gel ...

{Abstract}: Farnesol dehydrogenase (FDL) orchestrates the oxidation reaction catalyzing farnesol to farnesal, a key step in the juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis pathway of insects and hence, represents a lucrative target for developing insect growth regulators (IGRs). However, information on the structural and functional characterization of JH-specific farnesol dehydrogenase in insects remains elusive. Herein, we identified a transcript that encodes farnesol dehydrogenase (HaFDL) from Helicoverpa armigera, a major pest of cotton. The investigations of molecular assembly, biochemical analysis and spatio-temporal expression profiling showed that HaFDL exists as a soluble homo-tetrameric form, exhibits a broad substrate affinity and is involved in the JH-specific farnesol oxidation in H. armigera. Additionally, the study presents the first crystal structure of the HaFDL-NADP enzyme complex determined at 1.6 Å resolution. Structural analysis revealed that HaFDL belongs to the NADP-specific cP2 subfamily of the classical sh...

{Abstract}: Two coordination compounds of Co(II) and Cu(II) viz. [Co(2,6-PDC)(Hdmpz)3]·H2O (1) and [Cu(2,6-PDC)(Hdmpz)2] (2) (2,6-PDC = 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate, Hdmpz = 3,5-dimethylpyrazole) have been synthesized and characterized using single crystal XRD, elemental analysis, TGA, electronic, FT-IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Crystal structure analysis of 1 and 2 reveals the presence of supramolecular assemblies involving various non-covalent interactions. The crystal structure of 1 is stabilized by a structure guiding hydrogen bonded synthon involving the lattice water molecules and unusual double anion–π interactions involving the carboxylate moieties of 2,6-PDC. Unconventional CH⋯π(carbonyl) and CH⋯π(chelate) contacts involving carbonyl moiety and the chelate ring of 2,6-PDC observed in the crystal structure of 2 also provide rigidity to the layered assemblies. Such unconventional CH⋯π contacts involving carbonyl moiety and chelate ring of 2,6-PDC are scarcely explored. DFT calculations in combination with Q...

{Abstract}: Ferroelectricity in fluid materials, which allows free rotation of molecules, is an unusual phenomenon raising cutting-edge questions in science. Conventional ferroelectric liquid crystals have been found in phases with low symmetry that permit the presence of spontaneous polarization. Recently, the discovery of ferroelectricity with high symmetry in the nematic phase has attracted considerable attention. However, the physical mechanism and molecular origin of ferroelectricity are poorly understood and a large domain of macroscopically oriented spontaneous polarization is difficult to fabricate in the ferroelectric nematic phase. This study reports new fluid layered ferroelectrics with the C∞v symmetry in which nearly complete orientation of the spontaneous polarization remains stable under zero electric field without any orientation treatment. These ferroelectrics are obtained by simplifying the molecular structure of a compound with a known ferroelectric nematic phase, although the simplification...

{Abstract}: Calix[5]arenes have drawn attention due to their encapsulation capability for fullerenes. The high binding affinity between calix[5]arene and fullerene has enabled the development of various kinds of supramolecular fullerene polymers (such as linear fullerene polymers, helical fullerene polymers, and two‐dimensionally extended fullerene networks) and the structural regulation of covalent polymers. Herein, supramolecular ensembles formed via calix[5]arene‐fullerene complexation are reviewed in detail. More information can be found in the Review by Takehiro Hirao and Takeharu Haino.

{Abstract}: Supramolecular chemistry under mechanochemical conditions has drawn attention because it can induce low‐solubility molecules to self‐assemble, although most of the reported examples have been limited to two‐component systems. We applied mechanochemical synthesis to achieve multimolecular self‐assembly in more challenging three‐component systems. The produced crystals showed multicolor solid‐state luminescence depending on the components when exposed to UV light. Optical outputs and X‐ray diffraction studies were used to examine the self‐assembling behavior in greater depth. Using synchrotron radiation, in situ X‐ray diffraction permitted direct observation of the milling process, which started the self‐assembly process within 1 min. This research emphasizes the importance of multicomponent molecules with optical functions and self‐assembling behavior and offers the possibility of developing more complicated multicomponent crystals and organic solid solutions for advanced materials.(#br)The self‐assembly of mu...

{Abstract}: The supramolecular complexation of doxepin (DOX) with cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) was investigated in aqueous solution. The results indicated the formation of a host-guest complex, as verified by complexation-induced chemical shifts in the NMR experiments and supported by quantum-chemical calculations, in which the alkylammonium tail of DOX was found to be encapsulated inside the CB7 cavity, while the tricyclic moiety remained exposed to bulk water. Isothermal titration calorimetry and dye-displacement experiments provided a moderate binding affinity (104 M-1). Interestingly, the partial encapsulation of DOX by the CB7 macrocycle led to the development of a supramolecular assembly at a low millimolar concentration, as verified by NMR and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, which showed homogeneous size distributions with an average diameter of 1700 nm.

{Abstract}: A simple series of thiazole-urea-aliphatic chain-based compounds (1–7) were designed and synthesized using the principle of Crystal Engineering. The aliphatic alkyl chain of compounds was varied to obtain the delicate hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance between solute–solvent molecules required to attain the supramolecular gelation. Interestingly, all the compounds turned out to be excellent gelators for polar solvents including water mixtures with alcohols and acetonitrile. To get an insight into the packing of molecules in solid-state, solution, and gel phases various physicochemical techniques were employed such as SANS, SEM, PXRD, DFT calculation, etc. UV–Vis spectrometric measurements of compound 1 in the solution phase were carried out to establish the anion sensing capability. Very high sensitivity and selectivity of iodide ion in presence of other ions and degelation of acetonitrile gel of compound 1 in presence of iodide salts, make these compounds a unique class of LMOGs.

{Abstract}: Purely organic room temperature phosphorescence, especially in aqueous solution, is attracting increasing attention owing to its large Stokes shift, long lifetime, low preparation cost, low toxicity, good processing performance advantages, and broad application value. This review mainly focuses on macrocyclic (cyclodextrin and cucurbituril) hosts, nanoassembly, and macromolecule (polyether) confinement-driven RTP. As an optical probe, the assembly and the two-stage assembly strategy can realize the confined purely organic RTP and achieve energy transfer and light-harvesting from fluorescence to delayed fluorescence or phosphorescence. This supramolecular assembly is widely applied for luminescent materials, cell imaging, and other fields because it effectively avoids oxygen quenching. In addition, the near-infrared excitation, near-infrared emission, and in situ imaging of purely organic room temperature phosphorescence in assembled confinement materials are also prospected.

{Abstract}: Wide band gap (WBG) materials (i.e. Silicon Carbide (SiC)) are rapidly emerging in the semiconductor arena because of their properties (i.e. high capacitance, thermal stability, and wear resistance), which allow these substrates to be used as insulating wafers and transistors in integrated circuits (IC). During CMP, removable defects (i.e. particles, organic residues, pad debris etc.) and non-removable defects (i.e. scratches or corrosion) are generated on the wafer surface. Industry standards currently utilize aggressive post-CMP processing conditions, which may lead to further defectivity. This research focuses on a comparison between an industry-standard brush cleaning (i.e. contact mode) and an emerging megasonic cleaning approach (i.e non-contact mode). Implementation of supramolecular cleaning chemistries such as micelles, vesicles, and polyelectrolytes will be employed in both modes as an alternative “soft” cleaning process. Initial results indicate a correlation between the structure of the “soft” cle...

{Keywords}: Myofibrillar proteins;Filamentous myosin;Glycation;Dextran;Solubility
{Abstract}: Filamentous myosin is a self-assembling polymer that prevents myofibrillar proteins (MPs) from functioning in low ionic strength media. This study was aimed at investigating if glycation has the potential to improve the solubility of MPs in water. MPs were conjugated with monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides under wet reaction conditions at 37 °C. The conjugation was verified by SDS-PAGE, FT-IR and amino acid analyses. MPs conjugated with dextran (DX) exhibited a higher solubility and dispersion stability in water, which corresponded to smaller particle size and more uniform distribution (P < 0.05). According to secondary and tertiary structure analyses, the loss of α-helix structures and unfolding of the MPs appear to be the main reasons for MP solubilization. Additionally, according to the zeta-potential, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and atomic force microscopy observation results, glycation can provide electrostatic repulsion or steric hindrance to disintegrate existing filamentous...

{Abstract}: In contrast to ordinary condensed matter systems, "living systems" are unique. They are based on molecular compartments that reproduce themselves through (i) an uptake of ingredients and energy from the environment, and (ii) spatially and timely coordinated internal chemical transformations. These occur on the basis of instructions encoded in information molecules (DNAs). Life originated on Earth about 4 billion years ago as self-organised systems of inorganic compounds and organic molecules including macromolecules (e.g. nucleic acids and proteins) and low molar mass amphiphiles (lipids). Before the first living systems emerged from non-living forms of matter, functional molecules and dynamic molecular assemblies must have been formed as prebiotic soft matter systems. These hypothetical cell-like compartment systems often are called "protocells". Other systems that are considered as bridging units between non-living and living systems are called "minimal cells". They are synthetic, autonomous and sustainable...

{Abstract}: Photoisomeric supramolecular assemblies have drawn enormous attention in recent years. Although it is a general rule that photoisomerization from a less to a more distorted isomer causes the destruction of assemblies, this photoisomerization process inducing a converse transition from irregular aggregates to regular assemblies is still a great challenge. Here, we report a converse sol-to-gel transition derived from the planar to nonplanar photoisomer conversion, which is in sharp contrast to the conventional light-induced gel collapse. A well-designed acylhydrazone-linked monomer is exploited as a photoisomer to realize the above-mentioned phase transition. In the monomer, imine is responsible for trans-cis interconversion and amide generates intermolecular hydrogen bonds enabling the photoisomerization-driven self-assembly.

{Abstract}: Teixobactin has been the source of intensive study and interest as a promising antibiotic, because of its excellent activity against drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens and its novel but not yet fully understood mechanism of action that precludes drug resistance. Recent studies have demonstrated that the mode of action of teixobactin is more complicated than initially thought, with supramolecular assembly of the antibiotic appearing to play a critical role in the binding process. Further studies of the interactions of teixobactin with bacteria and its molecular targets offer the promise of providing deeper insights into its novel mechanism of action and guiding the design of additional drug candidates and analogues. The current study reports the preparation and study of teixobactin analogues bearing a variety of fluorophores. Structured illumination microscopy of the fluorescent teixobactin analogues with B. subtilis enables super-resolution visualization of the interaction of teixobactin with bacterial ce...

{Abstract}: 圆偏振发光主要是指手性发光体系激发态的性质。由于其在信息加密、高分辨3D显示和智能传感器等领域的潜在应用而备受关注。圆偏振光除了可以通过物理方法获得，即使用线偏振片和四分之一波片的组合，还可以直接从具有光致发光或电致发光性质的手性材料中获得。目前研究者们已经开发了多种圆偏振发光材料，主要包括手性有机分子、手性金属配合物等小分子发光体系以及手性超分子组装体等复合体系。通过将手性组分与响应性功能基团结合而构筑的响应性自组装发光体系对实现智能圆偏振发光材料的发展起着重要作用。在这篇文章里，我们对手性超分子自组装发光体系对各种外界刺激的响应性能进行了总结和归纳，如光照、pH值、溶剂、温度、金属离子等。本综述通过对各种外部刺激对手性组装体激发态性能影响的总结和讨论，旨在进一步推动智能圆偏振发光材料在多学科领域的应用。

{Abstract}: The sequential vertical polyfunctionalization of 2D addend‐patterned graphene is still elusive. Here, we report a practical realization of this goal via a “molecular building blocks” approach, which is based on a combination of a lithography‐assisted reductive functionalization approach and a post‐functionalization step to sequentially and controllably link the molecular building blocks ethylpyridine, cis‐dichlorobis(2,2′‐bipyridyl)ruthenium, and triphenylphosphine (4‐methylbenzenethiol, respectively) on selected lattice regions of a graphene matrix. The assembled 2D hetero‐architectures are unambiguously characterized by various spectroscopic and microscopic measurements, revealing the stepwise stacking of the molecular building blocks on the graphene surface. Our method overcomes the current limitation of a one‐layer‐only binding to the graphene surface and opens the door for a vertical growth in the z‐direction.(#br)The first prototype of spatially defined graphene 2D hetero‐architectures bearing verticall...

{Abstract}: ConspectusAmphiphiles tend to self-assemble into various structures and morphologies in aqueous environments (e.g., micelles, tubes, fibers, vesicles, and lamellae). These assemblies and their properties have made significant impact in traditional chemical industries, e.g., increasing solubility, decreasing surface tension, facilitating foaming, etc. It is well-known that the molecular structure and its environment play a critical role in the assembly process, and many theories, including critical packing factor, thermodynamic models, etc., have been proposed to explain and predict the assembly morphology. It has been recognized that the morphology of the amphiphilic assembly plays important roles in determining the functions, such as curvature-dependent biophysical (e.g., liposome fusion and fission) and biochemical (e.g., lipid metabolism and membrane protein trafficking) processes, size-related EPR (enhanced permeability and retention) effects, etc. Meanwhile, various nanomaterials have promised great pote...

{Abstract}: Two co-crystals possessing fumaric acid and 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine ((#br)1(#br)) and fumaric acid and ethyl 2-picolinate ((#br)2(#br)) were prepared. The structure of both compounds was determined using single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The asymmetric unit of cocrystal (#br)1(#br) formed in a triclinic system with space group P-1 consists of one 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine and one half of fumarate, whereas cocrystal of (#br)2(#br) formed in a monoclinic system with space group P21/c consists of an ethyl-2-picolinate and a half of fumarate. Co-crystal (#br)1(#br) exhibits intramolecular O–H···N and N–H···O hydrogen bonds as well as intermolecular N–H···O hydrogen bonds, whereas co-crystal (#br)2(#br) exhibits intermolecular C–H···O and O–H···N hydrogen bonds as well as weak π‒π stacking interactions. Intermolecular interactions were investigated using Hirshfeld surface analyses. H···H (40.9%), O···H (32.9%), and C···H (8.2%) are the major interactions in (#br)1(#br) and H···H (41.6%...

{Abstract}: Five zinc(II) coordination compounds, [ZnCl2(isn)2] (1), [ZnBr2(isn)2] (2), [Zn(NO3)2(H2O)(isn)2] (3), [Zn(CH3COO)2(isn)]2 (4) and [Zn(isn)4(H2O)2](ClO4)2 (5) (isn = isonicotinamide), were prepared by the reactions of the isonicotinamide (pyridine-4-carboxamide, isn) and corresponding zinc(II) salts. Their crystal structures were determined by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction method. The coordination environment of zinc(II) is tetrahedral in the compounds containing small halide anions (chloride, bromide), 1 and 2. An expansion of the zinc(II) coordination environment to the octahedral is observed in the presence of the monodentate and bridging nitrate ions in 3. The coordination environments of both zinc(II) ions in dimeric acetate complex 4 is also enlarged in the comparison with 1 and 2, one zinc(II) ion being octahedrally coordinated and the other being pentacoordinated. The zinc(II) ion in 5 also reaches higher coordination environment (octahedral), which is enabled by binding of additional water mol...

{Abstract}: The structural diversity and tunable optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites originate from the rich chemistry of the metal halide ionic octahedron [MX6]n- (M = Pb2+, Sb3+, Te4+, Sn4+, Pt4+, etc.; X = Cl-, Br-, and I-). The properties of the extended perovskite solids are dictated by the assembly, connectivity, and interaction of these octahedra within the lattice environment. Hence, the ability to manipulate and control the assembly of the octahedral building blocks is paramount for constructing new perovskite materials. Here, we propose a systematic supramolecular strategy for the assembly of [MX6]n- octahedra into a solid extended network. Interaction of alkali metal-bound crown ethers with the [M(IV)X6]2- octahedron resulted in a structurally and optoelectronically tunable "dumbbell" structural unit in solution. Single crystals with diverse packi...

{Abstract}: The preparation of supramolecular cyclodextrin (CD) assemblies and control of their assembly mode through guest inclusion in CD cavities have been actively studied. Contrarily, there are limited reports on the control of the assembly mode of guest-free CD molecules by external stimuli. Herein, we report the use of 2-O-methylated β-cyclodextrin (2-Me-β-CD) as an effective building block in fabricating supramolecular assemblies with diverse morphologies and molecular arrangements through assembly mode control by various stimuli, such as temperature and solvent. When methanol and diethyl carbonate were used as good and poor solvents, respectively, 2-Me-β-CD formed an amorphous assembly through solvent evaporation on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. Increasing the drying temperature and using crystalline substrates, such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and sapphire, changed the assembly mode of 2-Me-β-CD to a head-to-tail channel assembly. However, when a 2-Me-β-CD/1-propanol solution wa...

{Abstract}: Antibiotic resistance has posed a great threat to human health. The emergence of antibiotic resistance has always outpaced the development of new antibiotics, and the investment in the development of new antibiotics is diminishing. Supramolecular self-assembly of the conventional antibacterial agents has been proved to be a promising and versatile strategy to tackle the serious problem of antibiotic resistance. In this review, the recent development of antibacterial agents based on supramolecular self-assembly strategies will be introduced.

{Abstract}: Concise and general synthesis protocols are reported to generate all-syn mono-, di- and tri-alkylated cyclohexanes where a single fluorine is located on the remaining carbons of the ring. The alkyl groups are positioned to lie equatorially and to have triaxial C-F bonds imparting polarity to these ring systems. Intermolecular electrostatic interactions in the solid-state structure of the trialkylated systems are explored and the resultant supramolecular order opens up prospects for design in soft materials.

{Abstract}: A cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) based supramolecular assembly CB[6]-[NDS]2- (1, NDS = 2,6-naphthalenedisulfonic acid anion) was used to detect dyes such as reactive blue 19 (RB19), rhodamine B (RB), methyl orange (MO), methyl red (MR), and methyl violet (MV), and isoquinoline antibiotics such as berberine (BER) and palmatine (PAL) with detection limits of 143, 128, 374, 193, 305, 27 and 34 ppb, respectively. Simultaneously, 1 also displayed high adsorption abilities towards these organic molecules. These results indicate that 1 is a favorable material for the simultaneous selective detection and removal of specific dyes and antibiotics from water, being potentially useful in monitoring water quality and treating wastewater. The possible mechanisms of the detection and adsorption are also proposed.

{Abstract}: Although the construction of specific functional crystalline materials is still challenging, the multi-component molecular assembly has become a key solution for the design of functional materials. Here, we report a hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF) material FJU-360 constructed from disodium 6‑hydroxy-5-[(4-sulfophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenesulfonate (SSY) and terephthalimidamide. The charge-assisted hydrogen bonding between amidinium and sulfonate makes FJU-360 produce much stronger fluorescence than SSY, and can be used as a luminescence sensor to rapidly quench aniline through luminescence quenching. FJU-360 is sensitive and highly selective for the detection of aniline, and the detection limit reached 3.2 nmol/L, which is the lowest value reported currently. The mechanism of aniline response was analyzed through the aniline@FJU-360 single crystal structure, and the luminescence mechanism was clarified through density function theory calculations. This work is an important step towards the rational synth...

{Abstract}: Azobenzene derivatives have become one of the most famous photoresponsive chromophores in the past few decades for their reversible molecular switches upon the irradiation of actinic light. To meet the ever-increasing requirements for applications in materials science, biomedicine, and light-driven devices, it is usually necessary to adjust their photochemical property from the molecular level by changing the substituents on the benzene rings of azobenzene groups. Among the diverse azobenzene derivatives, azopyridine combines the photoresponsive feature of azobenzene groups and the supramolecular function of pyridyl moieties in one molecule. This unique feature provides pH-responsiveness and hydrogen/halogen/coordination binding sites in the same chromophore, paving a new way to prepare multi-functional responsive materials through non-covalent interactions and reversible chemical reactions. This review summarizes the photochemical and photophysical properties of azopyridine derivatives in supramolecular stat...

{Abstract}: The tolerance of amino acid starvation is fundamental to robust cellular fitness. Asparagine depletion is lethal to some cancer cells, a vulnerability that can be exploited clinically. We report that resistance to asparagine starvation is uniquely dependent on an N-terminal low-complexity domain of GSK3α, which its paralog GSK3β lacks. In response to depletion of specific amino acids, including asparagine, leucine, and valine, this domain mediates supramolecular assembly of GSK3α with ubiquitin-proteasome system components in spatially sequestered cytoplasmic bodies. This effect is independent of mTORC1 or GCN2. In normal cells, GSK3α promotes survival during essential amino acid starvation. In human leukemia, GSK3α body formation predicts asparaginase resistance, and sensitivity to asparaginase combined with a GSK3α inhibitor. We propose that GSK3α body formation provides a cellular mechanism to maximize the catalytic efficiency of proteasomal protein degradation in response to amino acid starvation, an adap...

{Abstract}: In contrast to unary assemblies comprising π‐conjugated organic species, elaborate modulation of dimensions, polymorphisms, and compositions of multicomponent assembled architectures with two or more constituent materials has not yet been systematically studied. Herein, a combinatorial library of organic microcrystals made of four components via a solution‐phase assembly route is reported. With the involvement of growth kinetics, four organic species with slight structural modifications can assemble into five unary assemblies, which may endow binary combinations with highly and partially structural miscibility. Consequently, a variety of binary alloyed assemblies and microscale heterostructures with tailorable dimensions, polymorphisms, and emission colors are realized by rational compositional and growth control. The effects of structural relations of binary combinations on their miscibility are systematically uncovered, that gives rise to these intricate microscale architectures as well as diverse energy tr...

{Abstract}: Tuning structures of solution-state aggregation and aggregation-mediated assembly pathways of conjugated polymers is crucial for optimizing their solid-state morphology and charge transport property. However, it remains challenging to unravel and control the exact structures of solution aggregates, let alone to modulate assembly pathways in a controlled fashion. Herein, we largely modulate aggregate structures of an isoindigo-bithiophene-based polymer (PII-2T) by tuning selectivity of the solvent towards the side chain versus the backbone, which leads to three distinct assembly pathways: direct crystallization from side-chain associated amorphous aggregates, chiral liquid crystal (LC)-mediated assembly from semicrystalline aggregates with side-chain and backbone stacking, random agglomeration from backbone-stacked semicrystalline aggregates. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that the amorphous solution aggregates, compared with semicrystalline ones, lead to significantly improved alignment and re...

{Abstract}: Amphotericin B, an antifungal drug with a long history of use, forms fungicidal ion-permeable channels across cell membranes. Using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, we experimentally elucidated the three-dimensional structure of the molecular assemblies formed by this drug in membranes in the presence of the fungal sterol ergosterol. A stable assembly consisting of seven drug molecules was observed to form an ion conductive channel. The structure is somewhat similar to the upper half of the barrel-stave model proposed in the 1970s but substantially different in the number of molecules and in their arrangement. The present structure explains many previous findings, including structure-activity relationships of the drug, which will be useful for improving drug efficacy and reducing adverse effects.

{Abstract}: In this study, we demonstrate the structural evolution of a two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular assembly system, which is steered by the thermally activated deprotonation of the primary organic building blocks on a Ag(111) surface. Scanning tunneling microscopy revealed that a variety of structures, featuring distinct structural, chiral, and intermolecular bonding characters, emerged with the gradual thermal treatments. According to our structural analysis, in combination with density function theory calculations, the structural evolution can be attributed to the successive deprotonation of the organic building blocks due to the inductive effect. Our finding offers a facile strategy towards controlling the supramolecular assembly pathways and provides a comprehensive understanding of the 2D crystal engineering on surfaces.

{Abstract}: A dinuclear copper(II) complex [Cu2(EGTA)(H2O)2]·(H2O) has been hydrothermally isolated. The structure of the complex is determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction and characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. Both copper centres adopt (4+1) distorted square pyramidal geometries. Due to the presence of water molecules in the structure, hydrogen bonds are mainly observed in the crystal packing. The energy associated with the hydrogen bonds is determined using DFT calculations. These interactions are also studied using hirshfeld surface analysis and energy frameworks.

{Abstract}: Among the different types of nanocellulose being investigated, bacterial cellulose (BC) or bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) is receiving tremendous attention due to its purity and superior features. Either alone or in the form of composites, BC finds diverse applications in different fields. However, the low yield and productivity of BC by microbial cells and the high cost of the bioreactors and medium components, perhaps due to limited knowledge of its biosynthesis mechanism and extracellular transport in microbial cells, are major constraints to the industrial-scale production and commercial applications of BC and BC-based products. Molecular studies revealed the involvement of specific operons (bcsABCD) in the biosynthesis, extracellular transport, and in vitro supramolecular assembly of cellulose fibrils. The yield and productivity, as well as the innate structural and functional properties of BC, can be modulated through genetic and metabolic modeling, which requires comprehensive genetic knowledge obtained...

{Abstract}: Photocatalytic water splitting is a desirable reaction that produces a clean and sustainable energy resource—hydrogen (H2)—from solar light and water, a process called artificial photosynthesis. Since the discovery of the Honda–Fujishima effect, significant developments have been made in the field of metal-oxide-based semiconductor photocatalysts, to achieve high solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiencies suitable for practical applications (>10%). One promising approach for utilizing the entire spectral region of solar light in the water-splitting reaction is to construct a Z-scheme photocatalytic system using a combination of O2 and H2 evolving photocatalysts with a redox-reversible electron mediator. However, these Z-scheme photocatalysts are still limited by backward electron transfer and back reactions at the photocatalyst–mediator interface. In contrast, indispensable molecules and clusters for natural photosynthesis are precisely arranged at the optimal position in protein scaffolds supported by ...

{Abstract}: Hypothesis(#br)Macroscopic nonequilibrium assembly helps to interpret the interfacial assembly mechanism and promotes the creation of self-adaptive chemical systems for potential applications such as controlled release and mass transfer. We propose that the precise macroscopic nonequilibrium assembly can be achieved by rationally integrating pH-responsive hybrid polymer hydrogels with the urea-urease clock reaction.(#br)Experiments(#br)Herein, pH-responsive and urease-containing polyelectrolyte hydrogels were fabricated for achieving macroscopic nonequilibrium assembly. Optical microscopy was used to visualize the interface of the macroscopic assemblies. Tensile tests were performed to investigate the adhesion strength of the assemblies and the modulus of the hydrogels. The charges and electric field distribution at the hydrogel surface were estimated by zeta potential measurements. Furthermore, an in situ sewing-growing method for fabricating hybrid polymer hydrogels with modularized surface chemistry was pr...

{Abstract}: Freshwater scarcity is threatening the health and life of people. As a portable water purification route, solar-driven water evaporation has attracted great attention. Although diverse light absorber materials were achieved for interfacial water evaporation, it is still desired to design robust and high-efficient photothermal materials. Herein, we employed a molecular assembly method to accomplish a PVA/PEDOT: PSS composite hydrogel (PPPH) into a carbonized melamine foam (CF) for the fabrication of PPPH-CF membrane, which is flexible, stretchable, and reusable for solar water evaporation. The water evaporation rate can reach 2.06 kg m−2h−1 with an amazing photothermal conversion efficiency of 96.9% under one sun. The as-prepared PPPH-CF membrane was also utilized for water purification, which exhibits an outstanding rejection ratio of salts, heavy metals, dyes, and bacteria. This facile, low-cost, and high-efficient water purification procedure can be envisioned for the large-scale and o...

{Abstract}: With the aim to investigate the influence of halogens on electronic structures and fluorescence properties, a new Salen type hetero-halogenated lanthanide complex [CeIV((±)3Br5Cl-salmen)2] (Ce-χ-L) was synthesized, and a set of optical properties were investigated. The complex was characterized by FT-IR, elemental analysis, UV and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and structural analysis revealed that halogen atoms plays a significant role in inducing the complex into a special intramolecular ‘X’ structure as well as supramolecular dimer assemblies. Theoretical calculations revealed that the introduction of halogen atoms is important for lowering the energy level of HOMO-LUMO the lanthanide complexes Schiff base complexes and also increase pathways of intermolecular interactions. pH stability test revealed the supramolecular assemblies of Ce-χ-L is sensitive to the variation of pH environment, and the accompanied assemble and disassemble behaviors are closely related to the substitution of halogen ...

{Abstract}: In this work, we demonstrate the formation of supramolecular architectures from the assembly of single-tail single stranded DNA (ssDNA)-amphiphiles. Short ssDNA sequences of 10 nucleotides that were either unstructured or formed G-quadruplex secondary structures were conjugated to a single 4-(hexadecyloxy)benzamide tail, either directly or through a polycarbon (C12) spacer. Conjugation of the ssDNA to the tail did not interfere with the G-quadruplex secondary structure of the ssDNA sequence. The ssDNA-amphiphiles self-assembled into ellipsoidal micelles, vesicles, nanotapes, and nanotubes. These nanotubes appeared to be formed by the rolling up of nanotapes. The increase of the hydrophobic block of the ssDNA-amphiphiles through the addition of a C12 spacer led to an increase in wall thickness and nanotube diameter. The presence of π-π interactions, through the benzoic group, was verified via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and played a critical role in the formation of the different nanostructur...

{Abstract}: Mixed-valence ruthenium trinuclear clusters containing dichloroacetates were synthesized, and the self-assembly of a single molecular adlayer composed of these clusters on a graphite surface was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM clearly revealed the dynamics of two-dimensional (2D) structure formation as well as the molecular characteristics of the adlayers at different electrochemical interfaces. The results verified that the design of metal complexes is important not only for redox chemistry but also for molecular assembly and nanoarchitecture construction.

{Abstract}: Medical nutrients obtained from plants have been used in traditional medicine since ancient times, owning to the protective and therapeutic properties of plant extracts and products. Glycyrrhizic acid is one of those that, apart from its therapeutic effect, may contribute to stronger bones, inhibiting bone resorption and improving the bone structure and biomechanical strength. In the present study, we investigated the effect of a bioactive glass (BG) addition to the structure–property relationships of supramolecular assemblies formed by glycyrrhizic acid (GA) and its monoammonium salt (MSGA). FTIR spectra of supramolecular assemblies evidenced an interaction between BG components and hydroxyl groups of MSGA and GA. Moreover, it was revealed that BG components may interact and bond to the carboxyl groups of MSGA. In order to assess their biological effects, BG, MSGA, and their supramolecular assemblies were introduced to a culture of human bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs). Both the BG and ...

{Abstract}: We developed an effective and specific colorimetric strategy to detect Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) based on hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)-induced supramolecular assembly of β-cyclodextrin-capped gold nanoparticles (β-CD-AuNPs). In this study, ssDNA aptamer of S. typhimurium could combine with CTAB to form the supramolecular ssDNA-CTAB composite, so the ssDNA aptamer was applied to control the concentration of CTAB. In the presence of S. typhimurium, ssDNA aptamers selectively bound to S. typhimurium but not to CTAB, leading to the host-guest chemistry reaction of CTAB and β-CD resulting in β-CD-AuNP supramolecular assembly aggregation with an obvious color change. The ratio of absorption at 650 and 520 nm (A650nm/A520nm) has a linear correlation to the log scale of the concentration of the bacteria (1 × 102-1 × 107 CFU/mL) with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 13 CFU/mL. In addition, this optical sensor has good selectivity and practicabil...

{Abstract}: Supramolecular chemistry under mechanochemical conditions has drawn attention because it can induce low-solubility molecules to self-assemble, although most of the reported examples have been limited to two-component systems. We applied mechanochemical synthesis to achieve multimolecular self-assembly in more challenging three-component systems. The produced crystals showed multicolor solid-state luminescence depending on the components when exposed to UV light.  Optical outputs and X-ray diffraction studies were used to examine the self-assembling behavior in greater depth. Using synchrotron radiation, in situ X-ray diffraction permitted direct observation of the milling process, which started the self-assembly process within 1 min. This research emphasizes the importance of multicomponent molecules with optical functions and self-assembling behavior and offers the possibility of developing more complicated multicomponent crystals and organic solid solutions for advanced materials.

{Abstract}: Supramolecular assemblies of gold complex‐based amphiphiles in aqueous media are highly structural sensitive to external environments, providing an attractive prospect for its application in soft functional materials. Notably, the development of a supramolecular assembly transformation of gold (III) amphiphiles directly controlled by counterion exchange is of fundamental importance for exerting the full potential of dynamic supramolecular assembly by external stimuli. Here we present a reversible supramolecular assembly of gold (III) amphiphiles controlled by counterions in aqueous media and their co‐assembly with gold nanoparticles.(#br)Controlled supramolecular transformation of gold (III) amphiphiles are responsive to external stimulations. We provide a study of counterion exchange to supramolecular structural transformation of gold (III) amphiphiles and their co‐assembly with gold nanoparticles.

{Abstract}: In this study, we investigated how the presence of multiple intermolecular interaction sites influences the heteromeric supramolecular assembly of N-[(3-pyridinylamino) thioxomethyl] carbamates with fluoroiodobenzenes. Three targets-R-N-[(3-pyridinylamino) thioxomethyl] carbamate (R = methyl, ethyl, and isobutyl)-were selected and crystallized, resulting in three parent structures, five co-crystals, and one co-crystal solvate. Three hydrogen-bonded parent crystal structures were stabilized by N-H···N hydrogen bonding and assembled into layers that stacked on top of one another. Molecular electrostatic potential surfaces were employed to rank binding sites (Npyr  C=S  C=O) in order to predict the dominant interactions. The N-H⋯H hydrogen bond was replaced by I⋯Npyr in 3/6 cases, I⋯C=S in 4/6 cases, and I⋯O=C in 1 case. Interestingly, the I⋯C=S halogen bond coexisted twice with I⋯Npyr and I⋯O=C. Overall, the MEPs were fairly reliable for predicting co-crystallization outcomes; however, it is crucial to ...

{Abstract}: Self-assembly and fibril formation play important roles in protein behaviour. Amyloid fibril formation is well-studied due to its role in neurodegenerative diseases and characterized by refolding of the protein into predominantly β-sheet form. However, much less is known about the assembly of proteins into other types of supramolecular structures. Using cryo-electron microscopy at a resolution of 1.97 Å, we show that a triple-mutant of the anti-microbial peptide plectasin, PPI42, assembles into helical non-amyloid fibrils. The in vitro anti-microbial activity was determined and shown to be enhanced compared to the wildtype. Plectasin contains a cysteine-stabilised α-helix-β-sheet structure, which remains intact upon fibril formation. Two protofilaments form a right-handed protein fibril. The fibril formation is reversible and follows sigmoidal kinetics with a pH- and concentration dependent equilibrium between soluble monomer and protein fibril. This high-resolution structure reveals that α/β proteins can nat...

{Abstract}: Small molecular NIR-II dyes are highly desirable for various biomedical applications. However, NIR-II probes are still limited due to the complex synthetic processes and inadequate availability of fluorescent core. Herein, the design and synthesis of three small molecular NIR-II dyes are reported. These dyes can be excited at 850-915 nm and emitted at 1280-1290 nm with a large stokes shift (≈375 nm). Experimental and computational results indicate a 2:1 preferable host-guest assembly between the cucurbit[8]uril (CB) and dye molecules. Interestingly, the dyes when self-assembled in presence of CB leads to the formation of nanocubes (≈200 nm) and exhibits marked enhancement in fluorescence emission intensity (Switch-On). However, the addition of red carbon dots (rCDots, ≈10 nm) quenches the fluorescence of these host-guest complexes (Switch-Off) providing flexibility in the user-defined tuning of photoluminescence. The turn-ON complex found to have comparable quantum yield to the commercially available near-inf...

{Abstract}: 谷胱甘肽过氧化物酶（GPx）是体内一种重要的抗氧化酶，对GPx的人工模拟能够拓展其体外应用，利用生命体内天然pH差异实现响应的pH敏感性GPx人工酶更是有着广泛的潜在应用。然而目前制备的pH敏感性GPx人工酶普遍存在活性较低的缺点，本文设计合成了同时含有高活性GPx催化中心和两个伯胺基团的乙胺单碲醚分子，酶促反应动力学的分析结果表明其二级反应速率常数高达101L·mol-1·min-1数量级。pH=6时，乙胺单碲醚分子能够与葫芦[6]脲分子（CB[6]）组装形成分子机器，此时活性中心被包埋于CB[6]的疏水空腔之中，仅能展现出（0.04±0.02）μmol·min-1·μmol-1的活性；pH=7时，分子机器部分分解，能够展现出高达（0.35±0.06）μmol·min-1·μmol-1的活性。因此，通过调控体系pH在6和7之间变化，借助分子机器的组装及部分分解调控人工酶活性的关闭与开启，从而构建了高活性的pH敏感性GPx人工酶。

{Abstract}: Natural products have been used to prevent and treat human diseases for thousands of years, especially the extensive natural small molecules (NSMs) such as terpenoids, steroids and glycosides. A quantity of studies are confined to concern about their chemical structures and pharmacological activities at the monomolecular level, whereas the spontaneous assemblies of them in liquids yielding supramolecular structures have not been clearly understood deeply. Compared to the macromolecules or synthetic small molecular compounds, NSMs have the inherent advantages of lower toxicity, better biocompatibility, biodegradability and biological activity. Self-assembly of single component and multicomponent co-assembly are unique techniques for designing supramolecular entities. Assemblies are of special significance due to their range of applications in the areas of drug delivery systems, pollutants capture, materials synthesis, etc. The assembled mechanism of supramolecular NSMs which are mainly driven by multiple non-c...

{Abstract}: The sequential vertical polyfunctionalization of 2D addend-patterned graphene is still elusive. Here, we report a practical realization of this goal via a "molecular building blocks" approach, which is based on a combination of a lithography-assisted reductive functionalization approach and a post-functionalization step to sequentially and controllably link the molecular building blocks ethylpyridine, cis-dichlorobis(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium, and triphenylphosphine (4-methylbenzenethiol, respectively) on selected lattice regions of a graphene matrix. The assembled 2D hetero-architectures are unambiguously characterized by various spectroscopic and microscopic measurements, revealing the stepwise stacking of the molecular building blocks on the graphene surface. Our method overcomes the current limitation of a one-layer-only binding to the graphene surface and opens the door for a vertical growth in the z-direction.

{Abstract}: This minireview introduces the research directions for the synthesis of supramolecular fullerene polymers. First, the discovery of host-guest complexes of pristine fullerenes is briefed. We focus on progress in supramolecular fullerene polymers directed by the use of calix[5]arene-fullerene interactions, which comprise linear, networked, helical arrays of fullerenes in supramolecular ensembles. The unique self-sorting behavior of right-handed and left-handed helical supramolecular fullerene arrays is discussed. Thereafter, an extensive investigation of the calix[5]arene-fullerene interaction for control over the chain structures of covalent polymers is introduced.

{Abstract}: An Au(III) complex, [Au(2‐ptp)2]Cl (1) (2‐ptp = 2‐(3‐phenyl‐1H‐1,2,4‐triazol‐5‐yl)pyridine), has been characterized by single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction technique and other spectroscopic data. Presence of different noncovalent interactions leads to the formation of 3D supramolecular structure. The complex 1 exhibits antibacterial activity against Gram‐positive (MIC) (Staphylococcus aureus [240 μg/ml], Bacillus subtilis [645 μg/ml]) and Gram‐negative (Escherichia coli [270 μg/ml], Enterococcus faecalis [820 μg/ml], Klebsiella pneumonia [785 μg/ml]) bacteria. Also, the toxicity of 1 has been checked by MTT assay. The complex shows promising anticancer activity against Vero cells and the CC50 is 405 μg/ml. The complex also shows improved conductivity (Λ) by one order difference on illumination (Λdark, 7.42 × 10−5 Sm−1 and Λillumination, 2.45 × 10−4 Sm−1).(#br)2‐(3‐Phenyl‐1H‐1,2,4‐triazol‐5‐yl)pyridine coordinated gold complex ...

{Abstract}: The self-assembly properties of aggregation-induced emission molecules play important roles in electroluminescence devices and fluorescence sensors because noncovalent interactions in self-assembly structures would accelerate the excitation energy consumption. However, there are only few studies to explore their self-assembly properties on the interface and there is still a great need for further understanding self-assembled mechanisms from the viewpoint of molecular design. Here, we presented three X-shaped aggregation-induced emission molecules X1, X2 and X3, which decorated with different functional groups and alkyl side chains. The self-assembly structures were revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy technique in combination with density functional theory. Results showed that X-shaped molecules self-assembled into different structures, depending on their molecular structure, especially the functional groups. Furthermore, self-assembly structures could be regulated by adjusting solution concentration. In...

{Abstract}: Photophysical studies on a BODIPY-fullerene-distyryl BODIPY triad (BDP-C60-DSBDP) and its reference dyads (BODIPY-fullerene; BDP-C60 and distyryl BODIPY-fullerene; DSBDP-C60) are presented herein. In the triad, the association of the two chromophore units linked by a fullerene moiety leads to strong near UV-Visible light absorption from 300 to 700 nm. The triplet-excited state was observed upon visible excitation in all these assemblies, and shown to be localized on the C60 or BODIPY moieties. Using quantitative nanosecond transient absorption, we provide a complete investigation on the lifetime and formation quantum yield of the triplet-excited state. In the BDP-C60 dyad, the triplet excited state of C60 (τ = 7 ± 1 μs) was obtained with a quantum yield of 40 ± 8%. For the DSBDP-C60 dyad and BDP-C60-DSBDP triad, a longer-lived triplet excited state with a lifetime of around 250 ± 20 μs centered on the DSBDP moiety was form...

{Abstract}: The (Z) and (E)-isomers of an extended tetraphenylethylene-based chromophore with optimized two-photon-induced luminescence properties are separated and functionalized with water-solubilizing pendant polymer groups, promoting their self-assembly in physiological media in the form of small, colloidal stable organic nanoparticles. The two resulting fluorescent suspensions are then evaluated as potential two-photon luminescent contrast agents for intravital epifluorescence and two-photon fluorescence microscopy. Comparisons with previously reported works involving similar fluorophores devoid of polymer side chains illustrate the benefits of later functionalization regarding the control of the self-assembly of the nano-objects and ultimately their biocompatibility toward the imaged organism.

{Abstract}: Multicharged cyclodextrin (CD) supramolecular assemblies, including those based on positively/negatively charged modified mono-6-deoxy-CDs, per-6-deoxy-CDs, and random 2,3,6-deoxy-CDs, as well as parent CDs binding positively/negatively charged guests, have been extensively applied in chemistry, materials science, medicine, biological science, catalysis, and other fields. In this review, we primarily focus on summarizing the recent advances in positively/negatively charged CDs and parent CDs encapsulating positively/negatively charged guests, especially the construction process of supramolecular assemblies and their applications. Compared with uncharged CDs, multicharged CDs display remarkably high antiviral and antibacterial activity as well as efficient protein fibrosis inhibition.

{Abstract}: Chiral channels with highly mobile water molecules result from the robust self‐organization of a simple achiral acetamide. Fully reversible release and re‐uptake of water molecules takes place near ambient conditions, with efficient water transport and a good selectivity against NaCl suggesting it to be an efficient candidate for desalination processes.

{Abstract}: Rod-shaped nanoparticles have been identified as promising drug delivery candidates. In this report, the in vitro cell uptake and in vivo pharmacokinetic/bio-distribution behavior of molecular bottle-brush (BB) and cyclic peptide self-assembled nanotubes were studied in the size range of 36-41 nm in length. It was found that BB possessed the longest plasma circulation time (t1\2  35 h), with the cyclic peptide system displaying an intermediate half-life (14.6 h), although still substantially elevated over a non-assembling linear control (2.7 h). The covalently bound BB underwent substantial distribution into the liver, whereas the cyclic peptide nanotube was able to mostly circumvent organ accumulation, highlighting the advantage of the inherent degradability of the cyclic peptide systems through their reversible aggregation of hydrogen bonding core units.

{Abstract}: Cucurbit[10]uril (Q[10]), the cucurbit[ n ]uril with the greatest cavity, exhibits several new features in the development of the host-guest complex. Thus, based on Q[10] and π-conjugated molecule, oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) derivative (OPVCOOH), the host-guest complexes with three different interaction ratios of 1:2, 2:2, and 3:2 assemblies (Q[10]: guest) were fabricated. Depending on the host/guest ratio, the emission color of these complexes ranged from blue to yellow-green. The extra Fe 2+ coordinated with a bare carboxyl group of the Q[10]-OPVCOOH (3:2) assembly, obstructing its rotaxane structure and forming Q[10]-OPVCOOH-Fe 2+ assembly, which may be used as a coating for near-white LED bulbs.

{Abstract}: 浮选药剂是浮选技术的科学基础和关键，也是浮选过程强化的根本所在.浮选药剂分子通过范德华力、氢键、疏水力等弱作用力形成具有特定结构的胶束或半胶束，在固/液界面、气/液界面发生特性吸附，产生协同效应，为浮选新药剂的设计与开发提供了新的方向.本文总结了浮选药剂界面组装技术及其研究进展，包括：阴/阳离子捕收剂组装、离子型药剂与中性分子组装及金属离子配位调控分子组装等.浮选药剂界面组装技术的关键在于药剂间的缔合和界面吸附作用的调控，依赖于对分子、原子层面微观作用机制及其“构-效”关系的精确认知.在此方面目前尚未形成系统的理论，这制约了浮选药剂开发的效率.近年来，量子化学计算、分子动力学模拟、界面光谱技术等快速发展，为精确解析浮选药剂的界面组装机制提供了良好的支撑，是未来发展的重要方向.

{Abstract}: Cadherins and nectins are cell surface glycoproteins that function as cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) to drive the adhesion of cells and thereby organize them into higher‐ordered structures during early development. Homophilic associations among the cadherins and homophilic as well as heterophilic associations among the nectins lead to the formation of adherens junction that drives cell‐to‐cell adhesion. However, several studies suggest for the existence of complex cross‐talk among these CAMs, which remains to be explored in greater detail. Based on SPR‐based protein‐protein interaction studies followed by structure‐guided mutagenesis and complementary biophysical analyses, we observed specific heterophilic associations among cadherins and nectin family members mediated through their membrane distal ectodomains. In particular, N‐cadherin was found to interact with nectin‐2, E‐cadherin to interact with nectin‐4, and E‐cadherin and N‐cadherin were also found to interact with each other. In conclusion to these ob...

{Abstract}: The processes of hydrophilic Co(III)-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin supramolecular assembly with 4,4-bipyridyl in aqueous buffer media have been studied by UV–vis, 1D and 2D 1H NMR-spectroscopy. In the case of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, pyrazine and piperazine in aqueous solutions, no assembly was observed. Interactions of the hydrophilic Co(III)-tetraarylporphyrin with ionic micelles (cationic surfactants with different alkyl tail lengths) in buffer media were investigated. These studies were performed by the UV–vis, 1D NOESY-spectroscopy and dynamic lightscattering (DLS) methods. The metalloporphyrins were incorporated into the hydrophobic part of micelles, which led to Co(III) reduction to Co(II) in the Co-porphyrinate composition. The rate of Co(III) reduction accompanied by detachment of additional ligands coordinated on Co(III)-porphyrins or disruption of supramolecular dimers and depends on the surfactant concentration and nature. The results obtained indicate the possibili...

{Abstract}: Phospholipid-porphyrin conjugates (PL-Por) are nowadays considered as a unique class of building blocks that can self-assemble into supramolecular structures that possess multifunctional properties and enhanced optoelectronics characteristics compared to their disassembled counterparts. However, despite their versatile properties, little is known about the impact of the packing parameter of PL-Por conjugates on their assembling mechanism and their molecular organization inside these assemblies. To gain a better understanding on their assembling properties, we synthesized two new series of PL-Por conjugates with different alkyl sn2-chain lengths linked via an amide bond to either pheophorbide-a (PhxLPC) or pyropheophorbide-a (PyrxLPC). By combining a variety of experimental techniques with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigated both the assembling and optical properties of the PL-Por either self-assembled or when incorporated into lipid bilayers. We demonstrated that indepen...

{Abstract}: Precise control over the stimuli-responsive noncovalent interactions operative in a complex molecular system has emerged as a convenient way to realize applications in the detection and sensing of trace analytes, metal ion separation, uptake-release, in situ nanoparticle synthesis, and catalytic activity. This feature article focuses on the attributes and advantages of noncovalent host-guest interactions involving cucurbituril homologues (CBs) with a wide range of organic and inorganic guests, starting from organic dyes to drugs, proteins, surfactants, metal ions, and polyoxometalates. The unique structural features of CBs provide interaction sites for cations at the portals, polyanions at the periphery, and hydrophobic groups in its cavity. The facile complexation and consequent compositional and geometrical arrangements of guests such as naphthalenediimides, coumarins, porphyrins, and triphenylpyrylium ions with the host CBs led to remarkable changes in many molecular properties, especially aggregation, the...

{Abstract}: DNA is a polyanionic, hydrophilic, and natural biopolymer that offers properties such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and non-immunogenicity. These properties of DNA as an ideal biopolymer offer modern-day researchers' reasons to exploit these to form high-order supramolecular assemblies. These structures could range from simple to complex and provide various applications. Among them, supramolecular assemblies like DNA hydrogels (DNA-HG) and DNA dendrimers (DNA-DS) show massive growth potential in the areas of biomedical applications such as cell biology, medical stream, molecular biology, pharmacology, and healthcare product manufacturing. The application of both of these assemblies has seen enormous growth in recent years. In this focused review on DNA-based supramolecular assemblies like hydrogels and dendrimers, we present the principles of synthesis and characterization, key developments with examples and applications, and conclude with a brief perspective on challenges and future ou...

{Abstract}: In biology, nonequilibrium assembly is characterized by fuel-driven switching between associating and nonassociating states of biomolecules. This dynamic assembly model has been used routinely to describe the nonequilibrium processes in synthetic systems. Here, we present a G-quartet-based nonequilibrium system based on fuel-driven co-assembly of guanosine 5'-monophosphate disodium salt hydrate and urease. Addition of lanthanum(III) ions to the system caused macroscopic dynamic switching between precipitates and hydrogels. Interestingly, combined analyses of the nonequilibrium systems demonstrated that molecules could switch between two distinct associating states without undergoing a nonassociating state. This finding suggested a nonequilibrium assembly mechanism of topological reconfiguration of molecular assemblies. We detailed quantitatively the nonequilibrium assembly mechanism to precisely control the phase behaviors of the active materials; thus, we were able to use the materials for transient-gel-temp...

{Abstract}: Despite recent progress, it remains challenging to program biomacromolecules to assemble into discrete nanostructures with pre‐determined sizes and topologies. We report here a novel strategy to address this challenge. By using two orthogonal pairs of heterodimeric coiled coils as the building blocks, we constructed six discrete supramolecular assemblies, each composed of a prescribed number of coiled coil components. Within these assemblies, different coiled coils were connected via end‐to‐side covalent linkages strategically pre‐installed between the non‐complementary pairs. The overall topological features of two highly complex assemblies, a “barbell” and a “quadrilateral” form, were characterized experimentally and were in good agreement to the designs. This work expands the design paradigms for peptide‐based discrete supramolecular assemblies and will provide a route for de novo fabrication of functional protein materials.(#br)A novel strategy for constructing peptide‐based supramolecular assemblies with...

{Abstract}: Host-guest chemistry, particularly of supramolecules, has been an intriguing topic for researchers for a long time due to its multiplicative applications ranging from chemical to biological to materials science. Supramolecules, such as calixarenes, are excellent host molecular systems due to their controllable cavity along with the ease of functionalization both at the lower and upper rims. The host-guest interactions involving calixarenes have been primarily studied using physical methods, such as absorption, fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry and mass spectrometry. The corresponding literature as disseminated through review articles triggered broadening of the spectrum of research. Depending upon the nature of the derivatization, the supramolecular conjugates of calixarenes have been shown to form different morphologies of micro and nanometric size as reported in the literature. Pertinent research performed in our own group was based on atomic force mi...

{Abstract}: Conformational regulation among two or more distant sites is not only one of the main pathways to accomplish multiple tasks in complex biological systems but also represents a powerful strategy to obtain stimuli-responsive supramolecular nanoconstructs with tailored physicochemical performance. We herein report the fabrication of a photochromic supramolecular assembly, which can be synergistically activated by the conformational regulation with bis(4,8-disulfonato-1,5-naphtho)-32-crown-8 and then reversibly switched by the through-space communication between restricted stilbazolium salt and photochromic dithienylethene. This work demonstrates that the synergistic conformational modulation via intra- and intermolecular interactions can be developed as a generalizable approach to construct more advanced biomimetic nanomaterials.

{Abstract}: 利用三聚氰胺（Melamine）和三聚氰酸（Cyanuric acid）分子间的氢键相互作用，在DMSO溶液中进行自组装制备球形超分子组装体（MCA）,然后将MCA与AgNO3复合，再进一步高温煅烧制备Ag@g-C3N4异质耦合复合多孔微球（Ag-MCA-CN）。利用傅里叶变换红外光谱（FT-IR）、X射线粉末衍射（XRD）、扫描电子显微镜（SEM）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）、紫外-可见光漫反射（UV-vis DRS）光谱和荧光发射光谱（PL）等对等对样品进行了表征。以甲基橙（MO）为目标污染物，在可见光照射下，考察了Ag-MCA-CN复合光催化剂的光催化活性。结果表明，与MCA直接煅烧得到纯g-C3N4多孔微球（MCA-CN）相比，Ag-MCA-CN比表面积进一步增大，禁带宽度减小，具有更强的紫外及可见光吸收性能，光生电子和空穴复合率降低，光催化活性明显增强。Ag-MCA-CN比表面积可达到74.8 m2/g,在可见光照射下25 min内对MO的降解率可达98%,降解速率常数k约为MCA-CN的2.9倍。

{Abstract}: The interaction of a heterocyclic azo compound with itself and with bovine serum albumin (BSA) is realized by probing the structural modifications in Langmuir (L) monolayers and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. It was found from the pressure-area/molecule isotherms that the elastic, thermodynamic, and hysteretic properties of the pure azo L monolayer were strongly altered due to the variation of temperature and pH of subphase water. In addition to that, the modification of such properties of the azo L monolayer due to mixing with BSA was also studied. The incorporation of BSA within the azo molecular assembly reduced the elasticity of that assembly. Such reduction of in-plane elasticity of the pure azo monolayer can also be achieved by reducing the temperature and pH of subphase water without adding BSA. A reduction in area per molecule of the azo assembly at the air-water interface associated with the conformational change from horizontal to vertical orientation facilitating π-π interaction was observed with in...

{Abstract}: Modulating enzyme activities or functionalities is one of the primary features of biological systems, which is, however, a great challenge for artificial enzyme systems. In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of self-assembling peptides from histidine and other amino acids (Asp, Ser, Lys or Arg), which exist in the active site of natural enzymes. These peptides could undergo a conformational transition from random coils to β-sheet structures under physiological conditions and formed self-assembled nanotubes with obvious hydrolase activities. After incorporation of transition metal ions such as Cu2+, these peptides could coordinate with Cu2+ ions, switch molecular conformations, and self-assemble into hybrid nanomaterials with altered morphologies and peroxidase-like activities. This work illustrates a facile approach for constructing artificial enzymes from self-assembling peptides with histidine residues whose catalytic functions could be modulated by incorporation of Cu<sup...

{Abstract}: Intrinsically disordered proteins are ubiquitous throughout all known proteomes, playing essential roles in all aspects of cellular and extracellular biochemistry. To understand their function, it is necessary to determine their structural and dynamic behavior and to describe the physical chemistry of their interaction trajectories. Nuclear magnetic resonance is perfectly adapted to this task, providing ensemble averaged structural and dynamic parameters that report on each assigned resonance in the molecule, unveiling otherwise inaccessible insight into the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics that are essential for function. In this review, we describe recent applications of NMR-based approaches to understanding the conformational energy landscape, the nature and time scales of local and long-range dynamics and how they depend on the environment, even in the cell. Finally, we illustrate the ability of NMR to uncover the mechanistic basis of functional disordered molecular assemblies that are important for h...

{Abstract}: Macroscopic supramolecular assembly (MSA) refers to rapid molecular recognition between macroscopic components (10 μm). Normally, MSA of rigid materials relies on a so-called “flexible spacing coating” beneath surface groups to provide high molecular mobility to realize multivalent binding. However, design principle of such coatings remains elusive. Here, we report an intuitive metric based on self-healing phenomena to judge whether a film can be a “flexible spacing coating” and apply this metric to extend film systems for MSA of rigid materials. The correlation between MSA and self-healing based on poly(ethylenimine)/poly(acrylic acid) films is revealed by similar dependence of assembly ratios and healing performance on film rigidity. Films capable of self-healing within 30 s can be used as flexible spacing coating for MSA. This metric is applied to three different film systems and proven effective to design coatings for MSA of rigid materials, which is applied in advanced manufacture of heterogeneous st...

{Abstract}: Various models of synthetic cells have been developed as researchers have sought to explore the origin of life. Based on the fact that structural complexity is the foundation of higher-order functions, this review will focus on hierarchical structures in synthetic cell models that are inspired by living systems, in which macromolecules are the dominant participants. We discuss the underlying advantages and functions provided by biomimetic higher-order structures from four perspectives, including hierarchical structures in membranes, in the composite construction of membrane-coated artificial cytoplasm, in organelle-like subcellular compartments, as well as in synthetic cell-cell assembled synthetic tissues. In parallel, various feasible driving forces and approaches for the fabrication of such higher-order structures are showcased. Furthermore, we highlight both the implemented and potential applications of biomimetic systems, bottom-up biosynthesis, biomedical tissue engineering, and disease therapy. This th...

{Abstract}: Traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), long the workhorse for specific target protein detection using microplate wells, is nearing its fundamental limit of sensitivity. New opportunities in health care call for in vitro diagnostic tests with ultrahigh sensitivity. Magnetic bead-based sandwich immunoassay formats have been developed that can reach unprecedented sensitivities, orders of magnitude better than are allowed for by the rate constants for a single ligand-receptor interaction. However, these ultrahigh sensitivity assays are vulnerable to a host of confounding factors, including nonspecific binding from background molecules and loss of low-abundance target to tube walls and during wash steps. Moreover, the optimization of workflow is often time-consuming and expensive. In this work, we present a simulation tool that allows users to graphically define arbitrary binding assays, including fully reversible first-order binding kinetics, timed addition of extra components, and timed wash step...

{Abstract}: This communication reveals co‐assembly of an electron‐deficient naphthalene‐diimide (NDI)‐appended polyurethane (P1) and electron‐rich pyrene (Py), forming an organogel with prominent room‐temperature ferroelectricity. In a non‐polar medium, intra‐chain hydrogen‐bonding among the urethane groups of P1 produces a folded structure with an array of the NDIs in the periphery, which intercalate Py by charge‐transfer (CT)‐interaction. Such CT‐complexation enables slow crystallization of the peripheral hydrocarbons, causing gelation with nanotubular morphology, in which the wall consists of the alternating NDI−Py stack. Such D‐A assembly exhibits ferroelectricity (saturation polarization Ps≈0.8 μC cm−2 and coercive field Ec≈8 kV cm−1 at 500 V and 10 Hz frequency) with Curie temperature (Tc) of ≈350 K, which can be related to the disassembly of the CT‐complex. In the absence of Py, P1 forms spherical aggregates, showing dielectric behaviour.(#br)Charge‐transfer i...

{Abstract}: The construction of multifunctional supramolecular assembly is a central research interest in solar-driven water splitting to hydrogen. We here report the successful preparation of a dual-functional supramolecular assembly via facile electrostatic integration of a positively-charged Ir-based chromophore and a negatively-charged nickel-substituted polyoxometalate catalyst. The resulting dual-functional supramolecule can form ordered vesicle-like assemblies and work efficiently as both light-absorber and catalyst for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. Under minimally optimized conditions, a catalytic hydrogen production turnover number of over 4000 was achieved after 96-hour irradiation, which is 17 times to that of discrete components under otherwise identical conditions. Destruction of such ordered vesicle-like assemblies will lead to a remarkable decrease of photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. Mechanistic studies further revealed the presence of both oxidative and reductive quenchi...

{Abstract}: “智能”识别及靶向癌细胞是精确诊断与高效治疗的关键。目前的策略中，使用小分子共价前体探针（或药物）存在机体代谢速度快及对其他器官毒副作用大的局限；使用纳米探针（或载药）体系则存在分子量不明确、生物穿透性低和易被网状内皮系统捕获等问题。肿瘤“原位自组装”策略兼具了小分子和纳米体系的优点，利用小分子作为前体可提高药物分子在肿瘤组织的生物穿透性，而自组装形成的纳米结构则提供了更好的生物利用度、更高的代谢稳定性和更长的滞留时间。在此基础上，研究者们通过设计多个肿瘤特异性生物分子顺次激活分子前体，进一步开发了小分子顺次级联自组装/解组装策略，以实现肿瘤组织的精准定位和肿瘤细胞的高选择性。在癌症的诊疗应用中，该策略可有效提高诊断信号的灵敏度，时空追踪癌细胞内的系列动态生物过程，同时实现药物的有效富集，并降低对正常细胞的副作用。该文概述了当前增强型级联自组装、级联自组装/解组装策略的研究进展，为癌症诊疗提供了新见解。

{Abstract}: DNA纳米技术在生物传感领域引起人们广泛的研究兴趣，现已构建多种二维和三维DNA功能纳米结构。滚环扩增（RCA）作为一种等温扩增技术，为DNA纳米材料的设计和自组装提供了新途径。该文通过RCA一锅法合成封装有辣根过氧化物酶（HRP）的DNA纳米花（HRP@DNFs），进一步基于双核酸适体识别构建光热生物传感器，用于肝细胞癌（HCCs）中循环肿瘤细胞（CTCs）的高灵敏、高特异性检测。当HRP包封到DNFs后，由于DNFs内部形成高度有序的氢键水环境，使得HRP的催化活性显著增强。为实现HCCs检测，在DNFs中设计了能够特异性识别HepG2 HCCs的核酸适体TLS11a作为信号放大标记物，同时制备了EpCAM核酸适体修饰的磁珠（EpCAM-MBs）作为载体捕捉HepG2细胞。当HepG2存在时，通过双核酸适体特异性识别形成MBs/HepG2/HRP@DNFs三明治结构。磁分离后，向体系中加入3,3',5,5'-四甲基联苯胺（TMB）和H2O2,HRP@DNFs催化TMB发生氧化。在808 nm激光照射下，氧化态TMB产生强的光热转换效应，从而实现对HepG2细胞的高灵敏、高特异性光热检测。该方法所建立的一锅法自组装DNA纳米花封装酶分子策略在癌症等重大疾病早期诊断中具有极大的应用潜力。

{Abstract}: 作为一类典型的金属-有机框架材料(MOFs),基于锕系金属节点的MOFs具有其独特的锕系-配体键合方式。然而，这些配位相互作用如何参与并影响有机配体的晶格组装过程仍有待研究。在本工作中，以咔唑三羧酸有机配体与铀酰离子的配位组装为例，通过控制合成条件详细研究了铀酰配位作用对咔唑三羧酸配体晶格组装过程的调控。单晶结构分析表明，随着铀酰金属节点的引入，咔唑三羧酸超分子组装体实现了从氢键-有机网络结构向金属-有机网络结构的逐级演变。在这一调控过程中，不同咔唑三羧酸间的连接方式由羧基氢键对逐渐被铀酰配位作用取代，二维网络结构也从六重穿插非平面网络转变为平面超分子网络和金属-有机配位网络。相关转变过程主要表现在羧基不断参与铀酰中心的配位作用，这一过程也得到了红外光谱的证实。通过本工作的开展，成功揭示了铀酰-配体配位作用调控无机-有机多孔材料合成的分子机制及相关材料结构演变的详细过程。

{Keywords}: Chirality Crystal engineering Helix Water transportWater Channel
{Abstract}: Achiral 2-hydroxy-N-(diphenylmethyl)acetamide (HNDPA) crystallizes in the P 6 1 chiral space group as a hydrate, building up permeable chiral crystalline helical water channels. The crystallization driven chiral self-resolution process is highly robust, with the same air stable crystalline form readily obtained from a variety of conditions. Interestingly, the HNDPA supramolecular helix inner pore is filled by a helical water wire. The whole edifice is mainly stabilized by robust hydrogen bonds involving the HNDPA amide bonds and CH … π interactions between the HNDPA phenyl groups. The crystalline structure shows a breathing behavior, with completely reversible release and reuptake of water inside the chiral channel, under ambient conditions. Importantly, the HNDPA channel is able to transport water very efficiently and selectively in biomimetic conditions. With a permeability per channel of 3.3 million water molecules per second in large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) and a total selectivity against NaCl, the HND...

{Abstract}: In land plants, both efficient light capture and photoprotective dissipation of chlorophyll excited states in excess require proper assembly of Photosystem II supercomplexes PSII-LHCs. These include a dimeric core moiety and a peripheral antenna system made of trimeric LHCII proteins connected to the core through monomeric LHC subunits. Regulation of light harvesting involves re-organization of the PSII supercomplex, including dissociation of its LHCII-CP24-CP29 domain under excess light. The Chl a603-a609-a616 chromophore cluster within CP29 was recently identified as responsible for the fast component of Non-Photochemical Quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence. Here, we pinpointed a chlorophyll-protein domain of CP29 involved in the macro-organization of PSII-LHCs. By complementing an Arabidopsis knock-out mutant with CP29 sequences deleted in the residue binding chlorophyll b614/b3-binding, we found that the site is promiscuous for chlorophyll a and b. By plotting NPQ amplitude vs. CP29 content we observed ...

{Abstract}: The current research work is about the efficient synthesis of three crystalline Schiff bases derived from benzene sulfonamides named as (E)-4-((3-ethoxy-2-hydroxybenzylidene)amino)benzenesulfonamide (ASES), (E)-4-((3-ethoxy-2-hydroxybenzylidene)amino)-N-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)benzenesulfonamide (SMB), (E)-4-((2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)amino)-N-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)benzenesulfonamide (SES) and their characterization by single-crystal X-rays diffraction (SC-XRD) studies. The molecular configuration of ASES and SMB is stabilized by intramolecular O-H⋯N bonding, whereas C-H⋯O intramolecular H-bonding is responsible for the stabilization of the molecular configuration of SES. The N-H⋯O intermolecular H-bonding is the main aspect of the supramolecular behaviour of ASES, while the N-H⋯O and C-H⋯O intermolecular H-bonding are the major features of the supramolecular behaviour of SMB and SES, respectively. The S-O⋯π interaction performs a significant role in the stabilization of the molecular assembly of the SM...

{Abstract}: Oil and chemical spills inflict serious detrimental impacts on the environment, the extent of which often exceed the domains of general flora and fauna. In order to tackle recurrent oil/chemical spillage events, the design and development of highly porous and lightweight absorbents, possessing both hydrophobic and oleophilic characteristics, have gained considerable momentum over the last several years. Particularly attractive for a fast and an efficient removal of high-viscosity fluids from water are three-dimensional (3D) graphene-based macromolecular assemblies (GMAs), conceptualized based on integration of 2D graphene and graphene oxide nanosheets in the form of aerogels, foams, beads, and porous films. This can be credited to their outstanding physicochemical characteristics and superlative mechanical features, including inherent hydrophobicity, enhanced oleophilicity, precise and physically linked permeable networks, enormous surface area, and profound porosity, amongst others. Herein, we provide a syst...

{Abstract}: The Front Cover shows the synthesis of one‐dimensional ladder‐like structures of dimethyltin carboxylates in an aqueous medium and highlights the role of chelating 2,2'‐bipyridine to control the dimensionality in the presence of 1,2,4,5‐benzenetetracarboxylate ligand. The structures reveal supramolecular assemblies formed by the inclusion of infinite water tapes [T4(0)A1] or the organic hydrate (bipy⋅6H2O). The study is a manifestation of reversible single crystal to single crystal structural transformation from P21/c to P212121 upon dehydration with conformational changes in the macrocycles.

{Abstract}: Despite recent progress, it remains challenging to program biomacromolecules to assemble into discrete nanostructures with pre-determined sizes and topologies. We report here a novel strategy to address this challenge. By using two orthogonal pairs of heterodimeric coiled coils as the building blocks, we constructed six discrete supramolecular assemblies, each composed of a prescribed number of coiled coil components. Within these assemblies, different coiled coils were connected via end-to-side covalent linkages strategically pre-installed between the non-complementary pairs. The overall topological features of two highly complex assemblies, a "barbell" and a "quadrilateral" form, were characterized experimentally and were in good agreement to the designs. This work expands the design paradigms for peptide-based discrete supramolecular assemblies and will provide a route for de novo fabrication of functional protein materials.

{Abstract}: The use of biomaterials for the inclusion and stabilization of biopolymers is an ongoing challenge. Herein, we disclose three-dimensional (3D) coiled-coil peptide crystals with metal ions that include and overgrow His-tagged fluorescent proteins within the crystal. The protein guests are found within two symmetry-related growth sectors of the crystalline host that are associated with faces of the growing crystal that display ligands for metal ions. The fluorescent proteins are included within this "hourglass" region of the crystals at a notably high level, display order within the crystal hosts, and demonstrate sufficiently tight packing to enable energy transfer between a donor-acceptor pair. His-tagged fluorescent proteins display remarkable thermal stability to denaturation over extended periods of time (days) at high temperatures when within the crystals. Ultimately, this strategy may prove useful for the prolonged storage of thermally sensitive biopolymer guests within a 3D crystalline matrix.

{Abstract}: The self-healing eutectogels with multifunctionality have attracted much attention in soft materials owing to their high conductivity and non-volatility. However, obtaining eutectogels with complete recovery of mechanical properties is still challenging. Herein, we developed a series of halogenated dibenzylidene-D-sorbitol (X-DBS) gelators. The X-DBS could form eutectogels in deep eutectic solvents obtained from choline chloride combined with alcohols or urea, which exhibit self-healing, complete recovery, load-bearing, and injectability. Fourier transform infrared, 19F nuclear magnetic resonance, and molecular dynamics simulations showed that the hydrogen bond between the C-F bond and the solvent molecule is key to the self-healing property of the eutectogels. Interestingly, the high ionic conductivity and self-healing property of our eutectogel make it potentially useful in a smart ionic conductor. Moreover, the self-healing eutectogels with corrosion resistance showed good lubricating performanc...

{Abstract}: Supramolecular synthons are the smallest structural units that contain the information inherent in building large molecular assemblies. Here, we apply solid-state NMR methods for the identification of the synthon in a cocrystal of Azelaic acid [(CH2)7(COOH)2]– Isonicotinamide [C6H6N2O]. It is observed that the spin-lattice relaxation time of protons in the cocrystal is long, implying that the choice of experiments, particularly those that involve low-sensitivity nuclei, could be time consuming. It is noticed that the two dimensional 1H double quantum (DQ) – 1H single quantum (SQ) correlation experiment at very fast MAS (60 kHz) is able to provide information on proton-proton proximities that leads to an understanding of the synthon structure. Experiments such as the CP-Reverse CP and 1H–13C HETCOR have been used to obtain spectral assignment which was additionally confirmed by first-principle GIPAW NMR chemical shift calculations. Present study indicates the basic u...

{Abstract}: SignificanceAtomic resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has opened up a new era of molecular science by providing atomic video images of dynamic motions of single organic and inorganic molecules. However, the images often look different from the images of molecular models, because these models are designed to visualize the electronic properties of the molecule instead of nuclear electrostatic potentials that are felt by the e-beam in TEM imaging. Here, we propose a molecular model that reproduces TEM images using atomic radii correlated to atomic number (Z). The model serves to provide a priori a useful idea of how a single molecule, molecular assemblies, and thin crystals of organic or inorganic materials look in TEM.

{Abstract}: Synthesis of inherently chiral materials and investigation of their self-assembly into molecular wires or 2D crystals belongs to hot topics in nanotechnology. Here we report an inherent splitting of orientational symmetry of 10–500 nm long molecular wires assembled from 3 nm chiral helicene-based macrocycles on atomically flat HOPG surface. The symmetry splitting of molecular wire orientation by a small angle of (6.5 ± 0.5)° is attributed to interaction of individual helicene-based macrocycle with HOPG. There is a good correlation between experimental AFM data and theoretical simulations using ReaxFF force field and Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential. In particular the new 1000 times faster computational method based on L-J potential and sequential addition of molecules is able to simulate formation of molecular wires and emergence of their symmetry splitting, which was not possible to do by conventional molecular dynamics. The method is also sensitive to chirality of the studied molecules; enantiomers and racemat...

{Abstract}: Cyclodextrins (CDs) are widely employed in biomedical applications because of their unique structures. Various biomedical applications can be achieved in a spatiotemporally controlled manner by integrating the host-guest chemistry of CDs with stimuli-responsive functions. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in stimuli-responsive supramolecular assemblies based on the host-guest chemistry of CDs. The stimuli considered in this review include endogenous (pH, redox, and enzymes) and exogenous stimuli (light, temperature, and magnetic field). We mainly discuss the mechanisms of the stimuli-responsive ability and present typical designs of the corresponding supramolecular assemblies for drug delivery and other potential biomedical applications. The limitations and perspectives of CD-based stimuli-responsive supramolecular assemblies are discussed to further promote the translation of laboratory products into clinical applications.

{Abstract}: This communication reveals co-assembly of an electron-deficient naphthalene-diimide （NDI）-appended polyurethane （P1） and electron-rich pyrene （Py）, forming an organogel with prominent room-temperature ferroelectricity. In a non-polar medium, intra-chain hydrogen-bonding among the urethane groups of P1 produces a folded structure with an array of the NDIs in the periphery, which intercalate Py by charge-transfer （CT）-interaction. Such CT-complexation enables slow crystallization of the peripheral hydrocarbons, causing gelation with nanotubular morphology, in which the wall consists of the alternating NDI-Py stack. Such D-A assembly exhibits ferroelectricity （saturation polarization P s ~ 0.8 µC/cm 2 and coercive field E c ~ 8 kV/cm at 500V and 10Hz frequency） with Curie temperature （ T c ） of ~ 350 K, which can be related to the disassembly of the CT-complex. In the absence of Py, P1 forms spherical aggregates, showing dielectric behaviour.

{Abstract}: In this review, we describe recent progresses on the stimuli-responsive hybrid materials based on polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) and their applications as a chemical sensor. In particular, we explain the unique functions originating from molecular assembly concerning POSS-containing soft materials mainly from our studies. POSS has an inorganic cubic core composed of silicon-oxygen (Si-O) bonds and organic substituents at each vertex. Owing to intrinsic properties of POSS, such as high thermal stability, rigidity, and low chemical reactivity, various robust hybrid materials have been developed. From the numerous numbers of POSS hybrids, we herein focus on the environment-sensitive optical materials in which molecular assembly of POSS itself and functional units connected to POSS should be a key factor for expressing material properties. We also explain the mechanisms of chemical sensors originating from these stimuli-responsive optical properties. Stimuli-responsive excimer emission and pollutant ...

{Abstract}: Color‐tunable smart afterglow materials in response to excitation wavelength and time simultaneously is highly important for anticounterfeiting and data encryption application, which remains a great challenge to date. Here, we provide a simple and efficient approach to develop color‐tunable afterglow supramolecular assembly AxBy@Lap in response to excitation wavelength and time simultaneously through the co‐assembly of non‐emissive nanoclay (Lap) and two different kinds of guests (A: Terephthalic acid (TPA), B: Terpyridine‐derivatives) using a simple solventless grinding method. Experimental and theoretical researches clear that the different decay lifetimes and origin for multiple afterglow emission centers bring about the aforementioned distinctive excitation wavelength‐ and time‐dependent feature. Furthermore, AxBy@Lap reveal excellent color‐tunable afterglow behavior with excitation wavelength‐ and time‐dependent feature in aqueous solution with water content of...

{Abstract}: An important challenge in organic electronic applications is to control the molecular assembly pathway towards organic coatings with desired morphologies. Here, new donor-acceptor napththylimido-azomethine oligomers with triphenylamine or carbazole as electron-donor unit are synthesized and investigated for their opto-electronic properties, with focus on the effect induced by morphological features. A novel structural pattern is approached, with naphthylimide and azomethine directly linked through NN bond. When oligomer films are prepared from different solvents by drop-casting and spin-coating techniques, rectangular sheets, worm-, island- or granular-like morphologies evolve, in conjunction with the molecular structure and processing conditions. Besides high thermal stability, the oligomers display overlapped localized and intramolecular charge transfer transitions involving main and degenerated molecular orbitals, which enable fluorescence modulation in dependence on solvent polarity. With the energy band ...

{Abstract}: Supramolecular features observed in the crystal structures of phosphoric triamides are mostly influenced by strong hydrogen bond interaction N—H...OP. With the aid of substituent groups a scenario can be created where the crucial role of weak interactions towards the stabilization of the overall molecular packing, in the absence of any strong interaction can be evaluated more reliably. In this context, we have studied the supramolecular features of three new phosphoric triamides 1 – 3, with [NH]P(O)[N]2, [C(O)N]2P(O)[N] and [C(O)N]2P(O)[NH] segments, respectively. The compounds crystallize in the monoclinic space groups P21/c for 1 and 2 with one phosphoric triamide molecule and in P21 for 3 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The intermolecular interactions and their energies are evaluated using Hirshfeld surface and energy framework analyses revealing that the presence or absence of substituent groups such as 2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl may serve as a crucial cohesive factor in the supramolecular assembly. ...

{Abstract}: In this work, three artificial light-harvesting systems are constructed by a supramolecular approach in aqueous environment. The water-soluble bipyridinium derivatives (DPY1, DPY2, and DPY3) were self-assembled with cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) to form the host–guest DPY-CB[7] complexes, which can highly disperse in water as small nanoparticles. The excited DPY-CB[7] assemblies can transfer energy to the sulfo-rhodamine 101 (SR101) molecules at a high donor/acceptor ratio. With the help of hydrophobic cavity of CB[7], the DPY-CB[7] + SR101 systems can works as a nanoreactor for effective dehalogenation of α-bromoacetophenone and its derivatives in aqueous medium under white light irradiation. Such light-harvesting systems has greatly potential applications to realize some organic photocatalytic synthesis in aqueous environment.

{Abstract}: Precise control of molecular arrangement is essential for functional molecular assemblies. A linear (I-shaped) amphiphilic block copolypeptide, polysarcosine-b-(l-Leu-Aib)6 (I-SL12), which has a hydrophilic polysarcosine (PSar) chain and a hydrophobic helical block, was reported to self-assemble into nanotubes by regular packing of the Leu side chains. Here, we have synthesized a T-shaped amphiphilic block copolypeptide, (l-Leu-Aib)3-AzF(PSar)-Aib-(l-Leu-Aib)2 (T-SL12), to investigate the effect of molecular geometry on the morphology of molecular assemblies. Unlike conventional I-SL12, T-SL12 self-assembles into helical nanotubes. A mixture of T-SL12 (a right-handed helix) and polysarcosine-b-(d-Leu-Aib)6 (I-SdL12, a left-handed helix) formed flat rod-shaped structures, while the mixture of T-SL12 and I-SL12 (both right-handed) forms nanotubes with an 80-nm diameter. This result indicates that stereo-complexes was formed between T-SL12 and I-SdL12. Peptidic flat-rod were obtained at ratios of T-SL12 and I-Sd...

The structure in each case adopts a one‐dimensional motif featuring ditin macrocycles with 2,2'‐bipyridine (bipy) or 1,10‐phenanthroline (phen) acting as the chelating ligand. For 1, the lattice water molecules in association with the framework form infinite T4(0)A(1) water chains. The organic hydrate, bipy ⋅ 6H2O in 3 adopts a layered structure comprising T4(2)6(2) water tapes and trans‐bipy.

{Abstract}: Wireframe DNA origami offers the ability to program nearly arbitrary 2D and 3D nanoscale geometries, with six-helix bundle (6HB) edge designs providing both geometric versatility and fidelity with respect to the target origami shape. Because individual DNA origami objects are limited in size by the length of the DNA scaffold, here, we introduce a hierarchical self-assembly strategy to overcome this limitation by programming supramolecular assemblies and periodic arrays using wireframe DNA origami objects as building blocks. Parallel half-crossovers are used together with lateral cohesive interactions between staples and the scaffold to introduce symmetry into supramolecular assemblies constructed from single DNA origami units that cannot be self-assembled directly using base-stacking or conventional antiparallel crossover designs. This hierarchical design approach can be applied readily to 2D wireframe DNA origami designed using the top-down sequence design strategy METIS without any prerequisites on scaffold...

{Abstract}: The self-assembly of molecules in two dimensions (2D) is gathering attention from all disciplines across the chemical sciences. Attracted by the interesting properties of two-dimensional inorganic analogues, monomers of different chemical natures are being explored for the assembly of dynamic 2D systems. Although many important discoveries have been already achieved, great challenges are still to be addressed in this field. Hierarchical multicomponent assembly, directional non-covalent growth and internal structural control are a just a few of the examples that will be discussed in this perspective about the exciting present and the bright future of two-dimensional supramolecular assemblies.

{Abstract}: In this work we show the use of high-resolution 1H MAS NMR to distinguish between two kinds of aggregation states of (1R,2S)-ephedrine, a chiral organic structure directing agent, occluded within AFI-type microporous aluminophosphates. We investigate in particular the supramolecular assembly of the molecules through π⋯π type interactions of their aromatic rings when confined within the one-dimensional AFI channels. A series of high-resolution two-dimensional spin diffusion spectra combined with molecular simulations and DFT calculations allowed us to distinguish different aggregation states of ephedrine molecules and precisely estimate the distances between the aromatic rings and their closest protons inside the zeolite channels as a consequence of distinct proton spin diffusion profiles.

{Abstract}: 近年来,基于分子组装产生圆偏振发光（CPL）的有机手性材料得到了迅猛的发展.然而,目前有机材料体系的CPL信号整体仍然较弱,且缺乏精准的调控手段.为此,本工作以具有光活性的聚集诱导荧光增强（AIE）性质的多硫苯基化合物（M-1）为荧光染料,以手性氨基酸L/D-赖氨酸盐酸盐（L/D-Lys）为手性模板,通过分子间氢键作用,在N,N-二甲基甲酰胺（DMF）/H2O的混合溶剂中形成超分子L/D-Lys@M-1共组装体.共组装体在不良溶剂水的溶剂作用下诱导产生CPL,且在紫外光激发下具有自聚集效应,产生持续增强的荧光发射和圆二色（CD）信号.通过荧光光谱、紫外吸收光谱和动态光散射（DLS）对组装体在光激发下的结构和光物理性质进行表征,利用CD光谱以及CPL光谱等对基态和激发态手性性质进行研究.结果表明,在溶剂诱导和光激发下实现了L/D-Lys@M-1组装体的手性传递和放大,且不对称因子(|glum|)达到了0.3×10-2.该研究策略为非手性的荧光分子构建CPL体系及动态调控提供了策略.

{Abstract}: Large protein complexes are assembled from protein subunits to form a specific structure. In our theoretic work, we propose that assembly into the correct structure could be reliably achieved through an assembly line with a specific sequence of assembly steps. Using droplet interfaces to position compartment boundaries, we show that an assembly line can be self-organized by active droplets. As a consequence, assembly steps can be arranged spatially so that a specific order of assembly is achieved and incorrect assembly is strongly suppressed.

{Abstract}: With the thought and strong hope of uniqueness and challenging characteristic highlights and importance of nanofibrous mats (NFMs) along with cyclodextrins (CDs) that having a significant opportunity, chances and handling a vital role in hostile to bacterial activities. For the most part, CDs are utilized to upgrade the antibacterial activity through the improvement of solubility, stability, and etc., to any molecule which can bring inside the CDs cavity via the formation of inclusion complexes. Polymer-mediated electrospun nanofibrous mats (PAN NFMs) are utilized as a nanocarrier for antibacterial activity in this article, utilizing nortriptyline (NP) as a reference molecule. As a result, NP forms an inclusion complex with β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD). As a result, the PAN NFMs are able to absorb it, thereby consolidating the complex NP on the nanofibrous surface. Additionally, the soaking of PAN NFMs in NP solution without β-CD was performed for comparison. To characterize the nanofibrous mats of NP/PAN and NP:β-C...

{Abstract}: The supramolecular assembly of DNA conjugates, functionalized with tetraphenylethylene (TPE) sticky ends, into vesicular structures is described. The aggregation-induced emission (AIE) active TPE units allow monitoring the assembly process by fluorescence spectroscopy. The number of TPE modifications in the overhangs of the conjugates influences the supramolecular assembly behavior. A minimum of two TPE residues on each end are required to ensure a well-defined assembly process. The design of the presented DNA-based nanostructures offers tailored functionalization with applications in DNA nanotechnology.

{Abstract}: Surfactants play a critical role in bottom-up nanotechnologies due to their peculiar nature of controlling the interfacial energy. Since their operational mechanism originates from the molecular-scale formation and disruption processes of molecular assemblies (i.e., micelles), conventional static-mode atomic force microscopy has made a significant contribution to unravel the detailed molecular pictures. Recently, we have successfully developed a local solvation measurement technique based on three-dimensional frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy, whose spatial resolution is not limited by jump-to-contact. Here, using this novel technique, we investigate molecular nanomechanics in the formation and disruption processes of micelles formed on a hydrophobic surface. Furthermore, an experiment employing a hetero-nanostructure reveals that the nanomechanics depends on the form of the molecular assembly. Namely, the hemifusion and disruption processes are peculiar to the micellar surface and cause a higher e...

{Abstract}: Nanoscience aspires to mimic nature's control over functional molecular assemblies. Here we present a templating technique for the efficient attachment of two different oligonucleotides to a homobifunctional molecule, enabling its controlled and programmable placement within a DNA nanostructure. We demonstrate its application to a range of organic molecules with different conjugation chemistries and water solubilities. We show that the two oligonucleotide adapters can be used to integrate a bifunctional cyanine dye into a self-assembled three-dimensional DNA origami nanostructure, giving control of both position and orientation. We also demonstrate the use of both adapters to exert dynamic control over the environment of the target molecule by means of a series of strand-displacement reactions.

{Abstract}: Abstract An achiral tripeptide, namely, Boc-γ-Abu-m-ABA-Aib-OMe (γ-Abu: γ−amino butyric acid; m-ABA: meta-aminobenzoic acid) was synthesized by solution phase procedure. The α, γ-hybrid peptide was designed in such a way that two dissimilar γ−amino acids, one flexible and another rigid, were positioned sidewise along with α-amino isobutyric acid (Aib) as C-terminal residue. The single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that two kinks were generated around centrally placed m-ABA. Interestingly, the peptide self-assembled via three intermolecular N–H···O and one intermolecular C–H···O hydrogen bonding interactions to supramlecular helical architecture.

{Abstract}: Graphitic carbon nitride (CN), as a non-metal material, has emerged as a promising photocatalyst to address environmental issues with the favorable band gap and chemical stability. The porous oxygen-doped CN nanosheets (CNO) were synthesized by an ecofriendly and efficient self-assembled approach using a sole urea as the precursor. The CNO photocatalysts were derived from the hydrogen-bonded cyanuric acid-urea supramolecular complex, which were obtained by pretreatment of urea at high temperature and pressure. The homogeneous supramolecular assembly was advantageous to the formation of uniform porous and oxygen-doped CN nanosheets. The formation process of the supramolecular intermediate and the CNO nanosheets were investigated. Moreover, doping amount of O in CNO could be controlled by the time of the high-pressure thermal polymerization of urea. The characterization results shown that the O atoms were successfully doped into the framework of CN by substitution the N atoms to form the C–O structures. The obt...

{Abstract}: Multifunctional and stimulus-sensitive intelligent nanodrug delivery systems (NDDSs) can significantly optimize the effectiveness of theranostic agents for cancer treatment. In this study, redox and pH dual-responsive nanocarriers (CPNPs) were prepared through molecular assembly by utilizing the Schiff base interactions of cystamine (Cys), PEG-NH2 and formaldehyde (FA) under aqueous conditions with a one-pot, one-step technique. First, the degradation products of CPNPs exhibited good biocompatibility, and the high concentration of intact CPNPs (200 µg/mL) could inhibit the growth of cells. In addition, doxorubicin (DOX) was encapsulated in CPNPs simply by changing the pH (DOX@CPNPs), and pH/GSH-responsive release behaviour was confirmed. In vitro, CPNPs significantly increased the uptake of DOX and enhanced the cytotoxicity of DOX to tumour cells. More importantly, DOX@CPNPs strongly reversed drug resistance in three different types of cancer cells, exhibiting significant anticancer effects. Collectively, thi...

{Abstract}: Synthesized three different supramolecular polymers, {[(4-BCBPY)0.5(H2BTEC)0.5]·H2O}n (1), {[(4-BCBPY)(C2H5NO)Cl]·H2O}n (2) and {[(4-BCBPY)(C2H5NO)Cl]·H2O}n (3) (H2BTEC2− = 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid anion). In compound 1, benzene carboxylic acid anion acts as an electron donor, and electron-deficient viologen acts as an electron acceptor to form a supramolecular assembly. In compounds 2 and 3, electron-deficient viologen forms supramolecular assemblies with N-methylformamide, water and chloride ions. All three compounds are connected through non-covalent interactions and form a donor-acceptor (D-A) system. Compounds 1, 2 and 3 all exhibited photochromic behavior of electron transfer, while also exhibiting interesting photomodulated luminescence behavior. And compound 1 can also be used as an ammonia vapor sensor material. The photochromic mechanism of the compound and the correlation between calculation and practice are deeply studied by using time-dependent density functional theory (TDD...

{Abstract}: A phonon band calculation scheme based on our previously proposed coarse-graining theory under periodic boundary conditions was formulated. Starting with a simple one-dimensional, one-body periodic system, we introduced the basis set of a phase-shift coordinate system that can easily afford the discrete Fourier transformation of vectors and matrices with infinite dimensions. When the unit cell contains two or more bodies, the basis set of the phase-shift coordinate system is represented with tensors. By choosing an appropriate tensor basis set of a coarse-grained space, we can approximately block-diagonalize the dynamical matrix. Then, we can obtain the inertia and stiffness matrices represented by the given coarse-grained coordinate system, upon which the application of the mass-weighted Hessian equation affords a set of angular frequencies (ω) as functions of the wavenumber (k). Thus, the phonon band structure (k–ω plot) is obtained based on the coarse-graining approximation. When this approximation is appl...

{Abstract}: Nitrogen-rich melamine has been often used by fraudulent merchants as an adulterant to food and dairy products which exhibit toxic effects leading to life-threatening diseases. This has triggered enormous activity on developing methods for the recognition of melamine in various food items for protecting public health and food safety. In recent times, fluorescence methods have emerged as powerful analytical tools for sensor development. The previously reported fluorescence-based methods for melamine detection, either require tedious synthesis procedures or operate through single wavelength-based signal output, making their accuracy susceptible to minute changes in the experimental environment. Herein, to overcome these limitations, we report the recognition of melamine which is achieved through the formation of a serendipitously discovered unique supramolecular assembly. The assembly consists of sulfated cyclodextrin, silver ion and melamine which, in turn, encapsulates a molecular rotor dye, Thioflavin-T, to ...

{Abstract}: The development of systems capable of responding to environmental changes, such as humidity, requires the design and assembly of highly sensitive and efficiently transducing elements. Such a challenge can be mastered only by disentangling the role played by each component of the responsive system, thus ultimately achieving high performance by optimizing the synergistic contribution of all functional elements. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel [1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene derivative equipped with hydrophilic oligoethylene glycol lateral chains (OEG-BTBT) that can electrically transduce subtle changes in ambient humidity with high current ratios (104) at low voltages (2 V), reaching state-of-the-art performance. Multiscale structural, spectroscopical, and electrical characterizations were employed to elucidate the role of each device constituent, viz., the active material's BTBT core and OEG side chains, and the device interfaces. While the BTBT molecular core promotes the self-...

{Abstract}: This work presents a set of Hg macrocycles of amide-phosphine-based ligands offering H-bonding cavities of different dimensions. Such macrocycles are shown to selectively adsorb anionic dyes followed by neutral dyes as well as Prontosil, a biologically relevant antibiotic, within their cavities with the aid of H-bonding-assisted encapsulation. Kinetic experiments supported by spectroscopic and docking studies illustrate the importance of the cavity structure as well as H-bonds for the selective adsorption of dyes.

{Abstract}: In this report, the crystal structure of a new polymorphic form of 2-(4-Methylbenzamido)-5-(4-fluoro-3-phenoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole have been investigated and compared with the previously reported form. Crystallization experiments from a non-polar solvent resulted in the formation of a newly obtained polymorph of this substituted 1,3,4 thiadiazole compound. Structural differences and similarities in both the polymorphic forms were explored in terms of supramolecular building blocks present in the crystal packing and their influences on the supramolecular construct are investigated in terms of the nature and energetics of the associated interactions. In addition, Hirshfeld surface analysis and calculations on the enrichment ratio were carried out for both the forms to isolate the various types of interatomic contacts and differentiate their contribution towards the molecular assembly, as obtained from 2D fingerprint plots. Also, the interaction energies were computed for the new polymorph and compared with...

{Abstract}: The glutathione-capped bimetallic copper and gold nanoclusters (CuAuNCs@GSH) were achieved through Au doping into the unstable copper nanoclusters (CuNCs@GSH), which induced the photoluminescence stabilization time increase from 4 to 7 days. Moreover, the Ce3+ introduction further significantly increased the stable storage time (from 7 to 25 days) and the emission intensity (near 140-fold), accompanying a quantum yields enhancement from 0.30% to 22%. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the Ce3+-induced larger assemblies of CuAuNCs-Ce3+ from monodispersive CuAuNCs@GSH nanodots. The fluorescence enhancement was attributed to the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property of CuAuNCs@GSH, where Ce3+ was bound to the ligands GSH and reduced the non-radiative relation of the excited states. Besides, the strong interaction between ATP and Ce3+ dissociated the CuAuNCs-Ce3+ assembly into monodisperse nanoclusters and recovered the weak lumi...

{Abstract}: An appealing and challenging cage structure along with an unusual biosynthetic pathway prompted us to explore an expeditious bioinspired one-pot total synthesis of nesteretal A. An unconventional strategy was chosen, and a cascade reaction starting from diacetyl was studied. Under organocatalytic conditions mimicking an aldolase, nesteretal A and a related cage analogue were anticipated by in silico metabolization, detected, targeted, and characterized.

{Abstract}: The combination of supramolecular chemistry and aggregation-induced emission-based luminogens (AIEgens) has recently attracted tremendous attention because of its ability to offer large emission enhancement even in substantially dilute solutions. In this work, a new aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-based supramolecular assembly has been reported, which consists of a polyanionic cyclodextrin derivative and a tetracationic tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative. Ionic cyclodextrins have attracted significant attention in host-guest supramolecular chemistry and pharmaceutical industry. However, ionic derivatives of β-cyclodextrins have not been explored to establish noncovalent interactions-based aggregation assembly of the most popular class of AIEgens, i.e., tetraphenylethylene derivatives. The current report demonstrates AIE of a tetracationic methyl pyridinium derivative of tetraphenylethylene (TPy-TPE) induced by a polyanionic sulfated β-cyclodextrin (S-βCD). The AIE-based supramolecular assembly has been t...

{Abstract}: Tubular fullerenes can be considered as end‐capped carbon nanotubes with accurate structure, which are promising nanocarbon materials for advanced single‐molecule electronic devices. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)‐C100, which has a tubular C100 cage with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end‐caps. As there are structure correlations between tubular Ce2@D5(450)‐C100 and spherical Ce2@Ih‐C80, their structure–property relationship has been compared by means of experimental and theoretical methods. Notably, single‐molecule conductance measurement determined that the conductivity of Ce2@D5(450)‐C100 was up to eight times larger than that of Ce2@Ih‐C80. Furthermore, supramolecular assembly of Ce2@D5(450)‐C100 and a [12]CPP nanohoop was investig...

{Abstract}: Chalcogenodiazoles have been intensively studied in recent years in the context of their supramolecular chemistry. In contrast, the newly discovered cationic 1,2,4-selenodiazole supramolecular building blocks, which can be obtained via coupling between 2-pyridylselenyl halides and nitriles, are virtually unexplored. A significant advantage of the latter is their facile structural tunability via the variation of nitriles, which could allow a fine tuning of their self-assembly in the solid state. Here, we explore the influence of the substituent (which derives from the nitrile) and counterions on the supramolecular assembly of cationic 1,2,4-selenodiazoles via chalcogen bonding.

{Abstract}: Cyclic electron transport/flow (CET/CEF) in chloroplasts is a regulatory process essential for optimization of plant photosynthetic efficiency. A crucial CEF pathway is catalyzed by a membrane-embedded NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex containing at least 29 protein subunits and associating with photosystem I (PSI) to form the NDH-PSI supercomplex. Here we report the 3.9 Å resolution structure of Arabidopsis thaliana NDH-PSI (AtNDH-PSI) supercomplex. We have constructed structural models for 26 AtNDH subunits, among which 11 subunits are unique to chloroplast and stabilize the core part of NDH complex. In the supercomplex, one NDH can bind up to two PSI-light harvesting complex I (PSI-LHCI) complexes at both sides of its membrane arm. Two minor LHCIs, Lhca5 and Lhca6, each present in one PSI-LHCI, interact with NDH and contribute to the supercomplex formation and stabilization. Our results showed structural details of the supercomplex assembly and provide molecular basis for further investigation of the r...

{Abstract}: Many structures in nature look symmetric, but this is not completely accurate, because absolute symmetry is close to death. Chirality (handedness) is one form of living asymmetry. Chirality has been extensively investigated at different levels. Many rules were coined in attempts made for many decades to have control over the selection of handedness that seems to easily occur in nature. It is certain that if good control is realized on chirality, the roads will be ultimately open towards numerous developments in pharmaceutical, technological, and industrial applications. This tutorial review presents a report on chirality from single molecules to supramolecular assemblies. The realized functions are still in their infancy and have been scarcely converted into actual applications. This review provides an overview for starters in the chirality field of research on concepts, common methodologies, and outstanding accomplishments. It starts with an introductory section on the definitions and classifications of chir...

{Abstract}: An unprecedented dinuclear Ni(II) complex [{Ni2(L)(HL)(μ-OAc)(H2O)}2]·3CH3CH2OH is successfully synthesized by the complexation of an asymmetric salamo-based ligand (H2L) and Ni(II) acetate tetrahydrate and characterized by elemental analyses, UV-Vis and IR spectra, and X-ray crystallography analyses. Surprisingly, in the asymmetric unit of the Ni(II) complex, a fully deprotonated ligand (L)2– unit and a partially deprotonated ligand (HL)– unit wrapps two Ni(II) atoms, with the μ-OAc– anion bridging two adjacent Ni(II) atoms. The two Ni(II) atoms possess different coordination environments and twisted octahedral geometries. The hexacoordinated Ni(II) atom (Ni1) is located in the N2O4 donor cavity, but another hexacoordinated Ni(II) atom (Ni2) is located in a NO5 donor coordination environment. Meanwhile, a1D chain structure is formed by two N–O⋯π interactions. Hirshfeld surfaces ...
